            "Happy Mother’s Day! Back in the early days of Pasta et Al, we began the tradition of dreaming up a special pasta dish for Mother’s Day. This quickly grew to include Valentine’s, birthdays, Christmas, Easter… But the fact remains, Mother’s Day gets a dish, and here it is!",
            "This year we’ve made a dough of limoncello and toasted perilla seeds, and turned it into doppio ravioli and agnolotti, filled with caramelised fig and mascarpone, goat cheese, and walnut. For a bit of fun, our agnolotti are nested inside the giant doppio ravs, in a delicious brown butter of walnut, limoncello, and apple cider vinegar, served with pomegranate molasses, freeze-dried blueberries, pink peppercorns, and a few edible flowers.",
            "And a big shout out to our pals at the Chillo Collection, who set us up with the incredible limoncello that features in this recipe. This hand-peeled masterpiece is a refreshing, local take on the classic, that manages a modern vitality whilst still tasting like something Nonna would be proud to have in her liqueur cabinet.",
            "So wipe down your benches, and let’s get into it!",
            "As always, start off by forming a flour well and bringing the dough ingredients together, kneading for 10 minutes and resting for 30, sealed up. While you wait, caramelise the figs and prepare both of the fillings, loading them into separate piping bags. Roll that dough out into sheets.",
            "Make the doppio ravioli by marking nested and centred circles of 4.5-5 cm, 10 cm, and 13-14 cm diameter on one of the pasta sheets. Small bowls and measuring cups can be useful for this. Pipe the fig filling generously into the centre circle, and the cheese filling between the outer two. Cover with the other pasta sheet and use the same utensils to first seal around the centre filling, smoothing the dough outwards, before sealing around the outer circle. Trim the outer scraps off with a rolling cutter. We used a nice ornate one from Coltelli Sardi in Nuoro.",
            "For the little agnolotti that nestle between the fillings of the doppio ravioli, pipe one filling down one long edge of a pasta sheet, and the second filling down the other. Roll the outer edges of the dough inwards over the filling, until sealed. Use a rolling cutter to separate the two lengths, and then divide into finger-width segments with a wooden dowel or skewer. Cut into agnolotti with a knife or straight rolling cutter. Drop the pasta into a pot of boiling salted water, and cook until done but still firm.",
            "Prepare the sauce by browning the butter until bubbling, then tossing in the ground walnut, limoncello, and apple cider vinegar. Stir it all together as it foams, and then drop the cooked pasta directly into the sauce, coating well.",
            "Plate up for mum on a drizzle of pomegranate molasses, and garnish with freeze-dried blueberries, pink peppercorns, and edible flowers.",
            "Buon appetito and ciao to your Ma!",

            "Ciao! It’s time for a post that we’ve been working on for a little while now. In fact, it’s been in the works for around 6 months. Near the end of last year, we decided to build a little seedling nursery in the garage, and teach ourselves how to grow a whole heap of perfect chillies. This is a step-by-step guide — everything you need to know — of how to grow your own. Plus a sneaky recipe for the very best fermented chilli sauce out there.",
            "We kept it nice and simple, so I’ll keep this simple too. First off, the garage set-up. I started out with two large seedling trays on separate heat mats, with transparent ventilating domes over the top, and a lamp hanging about 45 cm above soil level (at close to full power; you can of course dim the light and hang it closer). I connected my heat mats to thermostats with the thermometers in amongst the seedlings, and threw a couple of hygrometers in there for good measure.",
            "The lamp was connected to a programmable adapter, allowing me to program in 14 hours of light a day without running to and from the garage. All of this meant that I had full control of day and night temperature, humidity/moisture, and eventually wind during the hardening process (courtesy of my workbench fan). As a guide, chilli seeds need about 20°C to germinate, and the fruit needs 30°C to ripen, with night temperatures ideally not dropping below 15°C. I actually had one tray of chillies set to 26 degrees, and another for general herbs and veggies set to 24 degrees. I also kept relative humidity around 50%, but most chilli varieties seemed happy enough when it rose to 75-80% – you can mostly manage this with the dome vents, although I eventually propped the domes up on bamboo.",
            "The night before planting the seeds, I rehydrated jiffy pellets and gave them time to warm on the heat mats.  I also soaked the seeds in warm chamomile tea for 24 hours beforehand – this just softens the seed coat and can speed up germination.",
            "Refer to notes for your specific seeds, but most will sprout just fine sown to a depth of around 5mm. Don’t forget labels!",
            "Although this was mainly a chilli project, with 12 different varieties growing in our little seedling nursery (Aji White Fantasy, Anaheim, Buena Mulata, Bulgarian Carrot, Cayenne, Fire and Ice, Jalapeño, Padron, Red Cherry Hot, Serrano, Siam, and Tepin), we did also find space for parsley, Thai and Genovese basil, and Cherry Falls and Tommy Toe tomatoes. More excitingly, my Ma dropped off a bag of dried out seeds from my Nonna’s old basil patch that grew into the most determined and robust basil I’ve ever encountered. We eventually distributed plants to the family and grew a few enormous bushes of it amongst the chillies, ready for Tomato Day.",
            "Anyway, back to the chillies, make sure that your light’s going (for about 14 hours a day) as soon as your seedlings begin to sprout, and regularly mist the soil (no heavy watering) to keep it damp to the touch.",
            "After a couple of weeks most of your seedlings should be sprouting (for chillies, most will be out after a week although some may take two). At this point I gradually introduced a little artificial wind to help the little guys prepare for life outside. Once they reach about 5cm with two sets of leaves, they’re ready to pot.",
            "To help harden off our new chillies before moving them permanently out of the garage, the boys and I built a simple wooden frame (about 2 metres long) which we set on three sets of wheels (with a couple of brakes), with wire mesh stretched across the top. This let us set up a portable poly tunnel that could wheeled inside at night when it became too cold, and gradually opened up to the wind.",
            "We carefully cut the sides of the jiffy pellet netting, and then potted the seedlings in premium organic potting mix to which we’d mixed through about 10% perlite and 10% vermiculite.",
            "For reference, we used 17.5cm pots; to fill, it worked out as about one 25 litre bag of potting mix for every 10 pots, plus the perlite and vermiculite.",
            "We crammed these cosily into the poly tunnel, and then spent about 3 weeks lovingly wheeling them in and out (lessening the time in) and gradually opening up the tunnel until it could be completely removed.",
            "At this point we added a nice organic fertiliser, and gave a few of the high achievers their own stakes. Throughout this process, they should be getting two good soaks a day, but you may need to be gentle until they can hold their own against a toddler wielding a hose. Once they’re looking nicely upright, you can back off the water to give them a little heat, and once they’re all grown up it’s time to upsize the pot or stick them in the ground.",
            "With our typical enthusiasm, we ended up with over one hundred potted seedlings (around 80 of them chillies) from our trial run, so once they began fruiting we sold off all but 1-2 of each variety, and recouped quite a bit of our expenses. All up, about 2.5 months from seedlings to harvest.",
            "Of course, it wouldn’t be right to post all of this without a recipe. We love a good chilli sauce (check out our Tabasco Spaghetti alla Chitarra with Stracciatella and Roasted Tomatoes), and we love fermenting stuff, so here’s our home-grown fermented hot sauce.",
            "Happy growing, and buon appetito,",

                    "Transfer all chopped ingredients to a 1 litre jar. Stir the salt into the water until dissolved, and then pour until all ingredients are submerged. Weigh down the chopped ingredients using a pickling weight or small ziplock bag partially filled with water. Remove any seeds or other ingredients that have floated free to the surface. I recommend capping with a lid that can take a twin bubble airlock. This will allow bubbles to escape as it all ferments, without allowing anything into the jar from the outside. Alternatively, regularly burp your jar by carefully cracking the lid open every few days. Store in a cool, dark place (heat will interfere with the ferment).",
                    "After 7 days, you should have a decent ferment. You can check for signs like bubbles, escaped liquid, and a cloudy brine. Successful fermentation creates an anaerobic environment, where only beneficial bacteria can survive; if you let oxygen in you may find unwanted bacteria have moved in (as well as missing out on vitamin-rich predigested carbohydrates, you could make yourself sick). So if no signs of fermentation are evident, you may want to discard and try again. Note that you can also ferment your sauce for another week or two if you prefer more complexity of flavour.",
                    "When you’re ready to turn it into a sauce, drain out and retain the liquid. Thoroughly blend the chopped ingredients, add 50 ml of each vinegar, and slowly pour in the brine until it reaches a smooth consistency; this should take about 200 ml of liquid. Note you can vary the ratio of vinegars and brine to suit your taste. At this stage, add in any desired spices and herbs, or maple syrup if you’d like some sweetness to your sauce.",
                    "For a thin sauce, strain the mixture through a cheesecloth, otherwise transfer to bottles and jars, and refrigerate. The low temperature will slow the ferment, but you will still need to occasionally burp it (although using it regularly will have the same effect). It should keep for months, if you can make it last that long.",
                    "For a thick sauce as well as a thin sauce, blend the strained solids with the remaining 50 ml of each vinegar, and pour in the brine until it reaches your desired consistency. Bottle and refrigerate."

In fact, Little Al has recently (proudly) come up with his own nifty five-year old take on cellular respiration and photosynthesis that he loves to use in explanations of how much we need trees.

This is why I’m so excited about regenerative agriculture, and particularly delighted to introduce our new friends at Dirty Clean Food.",
            "The Story",
            "Regenerative agriculture is a beautifully non-linear array of connections and cycles between growers, distributors, consumers and, importantly, communities working towards not only sustainability but regeneration. Sustainability is about not making things worse, but it’s also not going to undo damage done, or change the trajectory that we’re on. Regeneration, on the other hand, might just save the planet. And it tastes really good.",
            "Excitingly (for a secret biology and ecology nerd), at its heart regen ag is about strengthening ecosystems and increasing biodiversity. This means topsoil regeneration, carbon sequestration, and strengthening of the water cycle. When it comes to growing, artificial disturbance of the soil is limited, nurturing the natural relationships between microbes, earth, and water. Similar restrictions on (or at least precision employment of) artificial inputs encourages the return of insects and animals, producing more robust and resilient ecosystems, that thrive with an accompanying emphasis on diversity of crops (and livestock where possible), ultimately costing less and producing healthier food.",
            "And, of course, soil is a great big carbon sink. So look after the soil, draw down carbon emissions, and cool the Earth (that’s another of Little Al’s models).",
            "Dirty Clean Food are the people connecting conscious consumers with conscious producers. It’s delicious food, regeneratively farmed, ethically produced, and local. We’re excited to be bringing you a few brand new Pasta et Al recipes over the next few months, focused exclusively on this good stuff.",
            "The Ingredients",
            "Every ingredient in our pasta dough this week comes courtesy of DCF. Eggs from happy chooks, olive oil from groves across our gorgeous south-west, salt from a pristine lake in the middle of nowhere, and stoneground flour from a family farm business down in the Great Southern. When stoneground, the three main parts of the grain are ground up together. The endosperm is softest, so ends up quite fine, but the bran and germ are tougher with larger pieces giving the pasta a delicious texture and flavour.",
            "For meat, we’ve gone with beef intercostals and bone marrow (for a fantastic hit of flavour and healthy fat), and a tray of Italian sausages (pinched in the middle and twisted into smaller lengths, just like Zia used to do).",
            "The passata this week comes from our very own Tomato Day, the bone broth is another family staple, and the basil has been lovingly grown out the back from seeds that my Ma salvaged from my Nonna’s garden.",
            "You can read a little bit more about each of our main ingredients, and see where they come from, by clicking around the stars marked on this map!",
            "The Pasta",
            "The three meat ragù is a classic dish. Typically a mix of pork and beef (or veal), we’ve upped the richness by swapping out one third of the bulk for bone marrow. The result is a simple, velvety sauce, with some deliciously slow-cooked meat on the side. It pairs perfectly with the earthy goodness of stoneground pasta, hand cut for a rustic touch.",
            "One of our more straightforward recipes, simply brown the meat, bust out a 15 minute soffritto, and then plonk everything in the pot for 4 hours. The boys are always in charge of basil.",
            "We use Nonna’s old trick of keeping it at a gentle simmer with the lid cracked open by the wooden spoon handle.",
            "To make the pasta, start with the usual flour well (wet ingredients in the middle) and form it into a shaggy ball. 10 minutes of kneading, and then 30 of resting sealed in cling wrap. You’ll notice that it’s firmer and responds differently to kneading compared to other flours. In general terms, this is because stoneground flour has a higher gluten strength than regular flour (and substantially more than 00 flour), as well as one of the highest protein percentages of all wheat flours. It’s still nice and easy to roll out and shape, although take care in giving it adequate hydration at the kneading stage – just run your hands under the tap if you find it tearing/being stubborn.",
            "To cut into pappardelle, prepare sheets of about 30cm in length. I usually just eyeball it based on the length of my knife.",
            "Cover these well with semolina, and stack them 4-5 sheets high. If they still feel a little soft or sticking, you can let them sit for 10 minutes or so to dry out a little.",
            "For fettuccine, we often fold the short edges into the middle before cutting across (this allows you to slide a knife underneath and shake them all loose), but for pappardelle I prefer an S shape fold.",
            "Once cut, separate the pieces and spread them out with a little extra semolina if necessary.",
            "To plate up, either lift the meat out of the sauce and serve it on the side, or throw it in like a heathen, as we do. Heaps of pecorino and a crack of black pepper on top, and you’re good to go!",
            "We hope you enjoy this deceptively hearty, thoroughly comforting little dish, and very best pasta wishes to you all. Buon appetito!",

Simmer for 4 hours, stirring occasionally; after a couple of hours, use a spoon to scrape the marrow out of the bones and stir it through the sauce.",
                    "While the ragù cooks, make the pasta by forming a well out of the flour, and adding the eggs, olive oil, and salt into the centre. Use a fork or your fingers to gradually bring the dough together into a shaggy ball, and then knead vigorously for 10 minutes. If the dough seems too dry, add water 1-2 tsp at a time; if too wet and sticking to your hands and the bench, add flour at a similar rate. Seal in cling wrap and rest somewhere cool for 30 minutes.",
                    "Chop the dough into four pieces, and then pass through a pasta machine. Begin at the thickest setting, rolling through a few times and folding over itself in between passes, before stepping through to a medium-thin thickness. Cut the sheets into lengths of around 30 cm, and stack in two piles, dusting with plenty of semolina as you go.",
                    "Fold each stack into an S shape, and then use a sharp knife to cut into pappardelle. We've cut ours into about 35mm widths, which is four pieces on a regular width sheet of pasta.",
                    "Toss gently to separate the pasta, adding more semolina if necessary, and then spread out on baking paper or a wooden board until ready to cook. If not eating immediately, refrigerate uncovered for 1-2 days, or freeze.",
                    "To serve, discard the bones from the ragù, and lift out the chunks of meat and sausages.",
                    "Drop the pasta into a large pot of salted boiling water and cook for 3-4 minutes, until still firm but cooked through (no white dough should be visible when the pasta is cut into). Lift out and drop directly into the sauce, stirring well to emuslify. If too dry or not sticking well, add a little pasta water as you stir.",

        "content": [
            "Buongiorno! It’s that time of year again… Just. Truth be told, Tomato Day this year only happened because I’m notoriously bad at reading and responding to messages. Life had spun out of control and it was suddenly the end of March with no sauce to be seen, when I received a message from my brother Adam about Tomato Day. I had assumed from the general radio silence that we’d all decided to give it a miss, but there he was asking if it was happening. So I reluctantly spun up some energy and spent the day clearing the garage, unpacking the sauce equipment, and badgering the family into discrete tomato-related tasks.",
            "My uncle was immediately and unstoppably up for the challenge, as the original tomato man, and had a guy lined up by the end of the day with probably the last Romas in Australia. My mum grabbed some regular tomatoes and came straight around from work so that we could use them to clean out the machine, sent my dad out to buy kilos of salt and then pressure clean the driveway, and later spent an unexpected two and a half hours looking for basil. My cousin made plans for an early start with baby in tow, roping in her mum, and squeezing it in before an afternoon commitment. And my startled father-in-law, by chance visiting from Sydney, found himself swept up in the unstoppable momentum of Tomato Day 2023. At which point my brother finished work, checked his messages, and explained that he was talking about Tomato Day 2024. By this point though, everyone was too excited and committed to the whole thing to back out, so poor Adam found himself unwittingly self-nominated for a 2.5 hour drive to get here before breakfast the next day. And of course his car was fated to break down on the way. Nonetheless, with about 24 hours’ notice, Tomato Day was on for another year!",
            "You may remember that two years ago my cousin and I restarted Tomato Day after almost 20 years. Life’s been tough since then, and we missed it altogether last year, but we’re back now with extra hands (the first time we’ve had the whole family together for it since I was a kid) and two extra babies (although our new one was technically stowed away in Rachel’s tummy in 2021). If you missed it, you can check out the full blog post here: Homemade Tomato Passata | Passata di Pomodoro Fatta in Casa. It explains a lot about the meaning of Tomato Day for us, and the history behind it. I’ll try not to repeat myself too much this year, so have a read if you’re interested in what’s behind this big, messy day.",
            "To the sauce. We were feeling confident this year, or at least the elders were feeling particularly weary, so with a whole heap of extra help we made the start a little later. 6am and the coffee was brewing, the garage rollers were up, and our fine spread of concrete driveway was ready for tomatoes.",
            "Everyone makes their sauce a little differently, but ours is basically bottled raw, and then boiled for a few hours. After washing and sorting the tomatoes, the main event for the day begins: the coring and deseeding. This is my favourite part. In fact I think it’s the part that holds families together.",
            "We get out the milk crates and the knives, and we sit around tending to that beautifully simple, repetitive task while we catch up, reminisce, laugh, and miss a few people who have disappeared over the years. The sauce is the goal, but those moments spent elbow-to-elbow are what we treasure, and I don’t think that any of us would care if every last drop of passata was lost.",
            "Once the watery insides are out, with a hand-crush to help them along, the tomatoes are heavily salted (it’s a ‘visual’ measure, but end-of-operation calculations suggest about 1 tbsp per kilogram of tomatoes) and then layered in clean bedsheets. These are then suspended and left for a while, allowing the water to drip out. They’re then gathered up and wrung out tightly, before being fed into the machine.",
            "During the first pass, the pulp is gathered up and later fed back through as many times as the machine (and our patience at unclogging it) will allow. My uncle tells me that the old hand crank machine, with an entirely different puréeing mechanism, would handle 4-5 passes, but our little current machine is good for about 2.5 (mixing some pulp in with fresh tomatoes to help it through). Still, it produced a nice consistency and concentration, with about 1.6kg of tomatoes to a bottle.",
            "While that’s happening, and the tubs are filling with fresh passata, the bottles and jars are sterilised. We do this with a bottlebrush and detergent handwash, before drying them in a warm oven.",
            "Then a few basil leaves are dropped into each, and they’re filled and capped before they cool.",
            "We then stack them up in our giant pots, layered between hessian sacks and towels to stop them rattling against each other while they boil. At this scale it takes about an hour to gently reach a boil.",
            "By then it’s lunch time, so we cook up a light sugo with a generous slosh of our fresh passata. Of course we have pasta too (our family’s signature ravioli), made the day before.",
            "Then we turn off the heat go to bed, and let everything cool in place overnight. The next day we unload the bottles, drain the pots, and admire our tomatoey handiwork.",
            "Despite the exhaustion, it’s sad to think that another year has to pass before we’ll be elbow deep in tomatoes again, sipping endless espresso and snacking on chilled prickly pears. But whenever one of us plucks a new bottle out to cook with, we’ll be taken straight back to that time spent sitting around together on milk crates.",
            "About a week after Tomato Day, as I was tucking him into bed at night, little Al said to me: “Daddy, for me, Tomato Day is even better than Christmases and birthdays.” He makes me a proud dad. I couldn’t agree more.",

            "We’ve had a few questions lately about double-sided striped pasta. It is a little trickier than laying stripes on top of a second sheet of pasta, but satisfying when you get it right (and of course more versatile in that you get your pattern on both sides). Working on our book over this last year or so, I’ve focused on pairing more complicated pasta with simpler sauces, and vice versa. It just allows you to save a little time on one element, and use that to create something special with another.",
            "So the dough and pasta is the focus here, although the confit purée is deceptively impressive for its simplicity – you certainly don’t have to sacrifice flavour to save time! This is our Striped Ricotta Fagottini with Garlic and Fennel Confit Purée.",
            "First off, prepare your two doughs. When I’m making multi-coloured dough, I often mix all but the colouring ingredients together, before splitting the dough into the required number of lumps. A food processor will then help to evenly distribute the colour throughout the relevant dough (in this case the spirulina). Add a little water if it becomes too dry while you’re doing this. Knead and rest.",
            "The confit purée is mostly hands off, so you can save a little time and have this cooking while the dough sits around. Just fill a thing with oil, bring it to medium heat, and then submerge the fennel, garlic, and rosemary. Drop to low heat and cook for 45 minutes, then allow to cool and blend until smooth, seasoning to taste.",
            "Returning to the pasta, roll that dough out into thick sheets and cut into fettuccine-width strips. You can use a machine cutter, though it may struggle with the thicker dough. If this is the case, use a narrow-set pasta bike or a sharp knife. On baking paper, lightly dusted with semolina, align the stripes lengthwise in alternating colours to the width of regular pasta sheets. Roll through the pasta machine to your final pasta thickness, medium-thin.",
            "Cut the pasta into 6-7cm squares, mix the filling ingredients together, and stick a dollop into the centre of each square. Make fagottini! Simply bring the corners together in pairs, pinching the very tips but leaving the top and edges open. Draw those same pinched corners together to meet above the filling, and press together to form a pyramid. Seal the remaining open edges.",
            "Fagottini certainly doesn’t have to be cooked potsticker style, but we’re kind of obsessed with it. So that’s what we’re doing here. Just fry it up in batches (flat side down), using around 2 tbsp of oil at a time, in a medium-hot pan until the undersides are brown and crispy. Add 1/2 cup of water, cover, and cook for a further 3-4 minutes until all of the water has been absorbed or evaporated.",
            "Plate the pasta with dollops of confit purée, a drizzle of oil retained from cooking, any fennel fronds that you’ve still got lying around (or deliberately retained), some edible flowers if you like, and a fresh crack of black pepper if that’s your thing. Simple, but sure to impress!",

                    "To prepare the dough, form a well with all of the dry dough ingredients, except for the spirulina. Add the eggs and 1 tbsp of olive oil into the centre and bring together into a loose shaggy mass.",
                    "Take half of the dough and blitz it in a food processor with the green spirulina. You shouldn’t need more than 1 minute to achieve an even colouration in the dough.",
                    "Knead both lumps of dough, the plain and green, separately for 10 minutes. You can either knead one in each hand, or seal one in cling wrap while you knead the other. Rest both for 30 minutes, wrapped tightly, away from heat and any direct sunlight.",
                    "While the dough rests, prepare the confit purée. Bring the oil up to medium heat in a frypan deep enough to submerge the confit ingredients, and then add the fennel, garlic, and rosemary. Drop the heat to low and cook for around 45 minutes, until everything has softened. Allow to cool, before blending until smooth. Season to taste.",
                    "Next, return to the pasta, and roll each dough in turn through a pasta machine. Beginning on the thickest setting, pass it through folding over itself a few times, and then gradually step it through to a medium-thick thickness. Chop the sheets into manageable lengths of around 30-40 cm.",
                    "Using a fettuccine attachment, cut both colours of pasta into long strips. If too thick for the fettuccine cutter, use a pasta bike on its narrowest setting, or slice by hand. Separate out flat on a lightly semolina-dusted wooden board.",
                    "On baking paper, arrange alternating strips of fettuccine side by side, to form a striped pattern of regular pasta sheet width. If the inner edges aren’t sticking to each other, lightly wet a finger and carefully run it down one of the edges before pushing the two back together. Trim any jagged narrow edges.",
                    "Dust the upper side of the new sheet with semolina, then flip over, peel the baking paper off, and dust the other side. Pass through the pasta machine, stepping through to a medium-thin thickness. Use a pasta bike (or knife) to cut into squares of 6-7 cm.",
                    "Mix together the filling ingredients with a fork, and then place a grape-sized dollop into the centre of each square. Bring the corners together in pairs, pinching the very tips but leaving the top and edges open. Draw those same pinched corners together to meet above the filling, and press together to form a pyramid. Seal the remaining open edges. Transfer to baking paper lined, lightly semolina dusted oven tray until ready to cook. Refrigerate uncovered for up to 24 hours if necessary.",
                    "Fry the pasta in batches (flat side down), using around 2 tbsp of oil at a time, in a medium-hot pan until the undersides are brown and crispy. Add 1/2 cup of water, cover, and cook for a further 3-4 minutes until all of the water has been absorbed or evaporated.",
                    "Plate the pasta with dollops of confit purée, any retained fennel fronds, a drizzle of oil left over from cooking the pasta, and a few (optional) edible flowers. Finish with a fresh crack of black pepper, if desired."

        "content": [
            "This week’s pasta is a quick little dish built on pantry staples. We’ve mixed our pasta dough up with a hit of smoked paprika, turning the typically green foglie d’ulivo into a more autumnal colour (for our northern hemisphere friends). They’re served in a warming but understated brown butter sauce flavoured with garlic, saffron, fennel, pepper berries, and rosemary. One of the easiest doughs to make, turned into a forgivingly rustic pasta shape, served in the easiest of sauces. A perfect short notice treat.",
            "To make the dough, mix the dry ingredients together, stir in the water, and then knead for 10 minutes. Note that it may feel wetter for longer as you knead (compared to egg dough), so give it a few minutes before adding in any extra flour. Rest for 30 minutes, sealed in cling wrap, away from direct sunlight and heat.",
            "To form foglie d’ulivo, roll the dough out into long ropes of around 15mm in diameter; chop into pieces of about the same length, and then roll between your palms to taper the ends. Use a thumb to lightly pin the upper edge of of each piece down against the work surface (a wooden board works best), and then draw a flat blade or bench scraper across it and towards you, spine first. I tend to do this at a 45 degree angle. Apply light downwards pressure to the knife so that the dough is stretched underneath it. You may find that it helps to regularly ‘open’ the upper edge of each piece back as it will want to roll over the knife. For the more traditional olive leaf shape, let it curl a little more; for broader leaves, stretch each piece open. Don’t worry if you mess it up – this dough is very forgiving. Just squash it up and try again.",
            "Transfer the finished pasta to baking paper lined, semolina-dusted oven trays. Allow to air dry and then refrigerate uncovered over night, or freeze until you’re ready to cook with them.",
            "For the sauce, melt the butter in a deep fry pan over medium-high heat, until it begins to foam. Incrementally add in the remaining ingredients, starting with the fennel seeds, mountain pepper berries, and rosemary, and finishing with the garlic and saffron (this at the last moment, to avoid it burning). Little tip: if you have trouble judging how brown the butter is in a regular dark frypan, try a lighter coloured enamel-coated cast iron thingy or similar.",
            "Once you’ve cooked the pasta, scoop a little cooking water into the sauce and whisk well to create an emulsion. Use a slotted spoon to drop the pasta directly into the sauce from the pot, stir well to coat, and then serve simply with a sprinkling of smoked chilli salt flakes.",

            "Spinach and ricotta was really my Nonna’s trademark pasta filling, stuffed generously into huge batches of ravioli and cannelloni. With a little Romano cheese, maybe some minced garlic, egg to bind it all, and salt and pepper. Simple perfection, and to this day my favourite filling. Well, this week, we’re turning things inside out.",
            "With the help of our gorgeous new pettine, we’re making garganelli, and tossing it through a sauce that we’ve based on Nonna’s filling: chicory and spinach chopped through fresh ricotta, with lemon zest to lift it.",
            "And because we like a little creativity in our pasta, we’ve added sumac to our dough. Sumac might not spring to mind as a quintessentially Italian ingredient, but in our southern neck of the woods (or rather our variously Mediterranean and semi-arid Mezzogiorno) it grows all over the place. With southern Italian cooking so heavily influenced by Arabic cuisine, its citrusy, tart acidity pairs well with so many other regional flavours, and of course with our lemony ricotta sauce.",
            "So grab yourself the freshest ricotta that you can find, and a pettine or gnocchi board to form those grooves, and let’s get into it.",
            "We’re so happy to have recently been gifted this beautiful pettine from our pal The Coastal Italian. These wonderful pasta tools are traditionally crafted from antique loom combs, with this one reclaimed and restored by Al Marangoun aka Marco Galavotti from the combs of a craftsman working in Reggio-Emilia more than 100 years ago. Now, of course if you don’t have a pettine you can use a gnocchi board or cavarola, but if you’re all out of hand-crafted wooden pasta tools: arrangiarsi! By which I mean that we once rolled garganelli out on a (thoroughly cleaned) wicker chair at the family holiday house…",
            "This dough starts like all good doughs, with a flour well and eggs in the middle. We’ve gone for a classic 100g flour plus one egg per person, with a mix of plain flour and semolina for a slightly firmer pasta. Add in your sumac, mix it all up, and give it a knead for 10 minutes before resting for 30. Don’t forget to hide it away from sun and heat. Thanks to a sunny house and an Aussie summer, our dough ends up in all kinds of weird places around this time of the year. On a chair under the table, behind the fruit bowl, in the tea towel drawer. Now that I write this it occurs to me that I could just use a cupboard.",
            "Roll your dough out and cut it into squares of about 4cm, then arm yourself with a dowel. For 4cm squares, a diameter of 1cm should be about right.",
            "Working one at a time, set the squares at a 45-degree angle to the dowel (like a diamond), wrapping and overlapping two opposing corners. Then apply light pressure and roll towards you to form the indentations and set the pasta into a tube. Transfer to lightly floured baking paper, and refrigerate uncovered for 1-3 days.",
            "Note that we prevent our garganelli from going flat by turning them on their sides once after they’ve air-dried for 5-10 minutes. As long as they haven’t dried out too much, you should be able to then give them a little poke to encourage them back open.",
            "For the sauce, boil the chicory for 10 minutes and then fry it gently with the spinach and garlic. If this is your first time cooking chicory, wash it thoroughly, wash it again, give it a shake, and then wash it once more to ensure that you’ve evicted all ‘passeggeri’, as my Ma calls them.",
            "Add all other sauce ingredients into the pan, and use a fork to smooth out the ricotta. Then once your pasta is cooked, stir it straight into the sauce, adding a little pasta water to help with emulsification. Serve with a crack of pepper!",

            "Though perhaps a little late in life, and unhelpfully complicated by its realities, if I could choose someone to be when I grow up, without a doubt I’d be Inspector Montalbano. Aside from pleasantly relatable traits, such as his warranted, weary grouchiness and exaggerated hand gestures, Montalbano is a man who pays food the respect that it deserves. The novels, and closely-adapted television series, feature a veritable dreamscape of food, and aren’t shy of lengthy pauses in crime-fighting for the sake of a fragrant sun-drenched meal. Even if we can’t all find a few hours in the middle of our work day to enjoy lunch by the sea or at home prepared by our housekeeper, relish your food like Montalbano and you’ll live a life of true contentment.",
            "Over the next few months we’re going to be cooking up a few recipes taken straight from the great commissario’s table. This week we’re starting with the incredible pasta con le sarde, one of Salvo’s favourite dishes. You can find this in Il cane di terracotta, The Terracotta Dog, when Adelina cooks it to celebrate Livia going home. Honestly, Livia, what a pest. It’s a magnificently simple and fresh Sicilian dish, showing some of those Arabic and North African influences in the raisins, pine nuts, and saffron. As the name suggests, it features sardines, one of my Ma’s favourite ingredients. And so, having the very rare opportunity to cook for her this weekend, con le sarde was meant to be.",
            "Pasta con le sarde is typically served with bucatini or spaghetti, so we’ve returned to our extruder for a fresh batch of squid-ink bucatini.",
            "Remember that the trick to extruded pasta is keeping the dough a little drier than you would for rolled pasta. It should clump together when pinched, but otherwise crumble like buttered breadcrumbs. Knead for 10 minutes, then rest it for 30. Run the machine on high speed, feed the dough in in walnut-sized pieces, and cut to lengths of around 30cm.",
            "As always, cook the bucatini in a large pot of lightly salted water until no raw dough is visible when the pasta is cut into.",
            "The sauce is fantastically simple. Just fry the fennel, onion, and anchovies over low heat for around 20 minutes, then add the wine and saffron, reducing it on medium heat until almost dry. Toss in the pine nuts, raisins and sardines, give it a minute, and stir in the cooked and drained pasta. Add a little pasta water back in if needed to aid emulsification with the sauce.",
            "Finally, stir in the lemon zest and juice, and serve with the breadcrumbs, fennel fronds, and a crack of pepper.",

            "A couple of weeks back I was enjoying a good glass of Montepulciano with a light pork ragu and a side of charred radicchio. How far I’ve come from Fruity Lexia and chip rolls. Anyway, I’d paired it so uncharacteristically well that it occurred to me I should probably stick it all into some sort of tortelli. And so this weekend’s pasta turned out to be a little ode to wine, pairing the dish to the vino, rather than the other way around. This is our pork and radicchio tortelli, made with a red wine dough, and served simply with smashed garlic fried in olive oil.",
            "I think that it was in an episode of Two Greedy Italians, unbelievably more than ten years ago, when Antonio and Gennaro pleaded with us to only cook with wine that we’d drink. Whether that was more out of respect for the dish or the chef having a glass while they toil is unclear, but either way it’s something that I took to heart. The Montepulciano that inspired this dish is from Alpha Box & Dice, McLaren Vale. We made it to their cellar door on a quick South Australia trip last year and they won us over with everything they brought out. I’ve been banging on about how good their wine is ever since, and the subtle flavour that it gives to this dough really does bring the dish together.",
            "Boil down the wine on high heat until it halves in volume, and allow it to cool. Then start off like you would any other pasta dough: form a well, add the yolks and wine into the centre, and stir together into a shaggy mass. Knead for 10 minutes, then seal in cling wrap and rest for 30.",
            "While you wait, fry one handful of basil leaves, then reserve them for plating. Make the filling by frying the pork and radicchio in the leftover oil, and then blend the, up with the ricotta, fresh basil, and egg. That should only take 10 minutes, leaving you plenty of time for your own leisurely glass of red.",
            "Roll your dough out to a medium-thin thickness, a 6 on a 9-setting machine, and then cut it into squares of around 7cm. Add a large dollop of filling to each, and then fold in half offsetting the points so that you are left with four corners on one side, and a straight edge on the other. Poke sideways on the flat edge, and then draw the outer corners around the dimple, to overlap slightly. The angle of overlap should be about the same as the angle between the other corners. Press firmly to seal, and you’re ready to boil.",
            "While your pasta bubbles away, smash the peeled garlic cloves with the side of a large knife, and gently fry them in a couple of tablespoons of oil until they start to get toasty. Toss the cooked and drained tortelli directly into the hot pan, and serve with a pinch of mountain pepper.",

            "I’m not going to say that we ran out of fresh ingredients due to poorly-timed lockdown grocery deliveries, but if that had hypothetically happened, this would have been the perfect pasta solution. This week’s cappelletti are made with a fennel seed dough and a simple, comforting filling of roasted potato and fennel. We served them up with crispy potato skins, a delicious agrumato, and a scattering of crushed pink peppercorns. Sometimes it takes a pantry emergency to remind you that the simple food is often the best!",
            "For all of the flours that we like to experiment with, good old all-purpose flour will always have your back. It’s been a while since I nerded out on gluten, and I won’t do it to you now, but I will summarise by saying that experimenting with flours is essentially just balancing protein percentage, gluten strength, and elasticity. That means that when we use a high ratio of 00 flour, which is fairly elastic and lower in protein, we’ll often supplement it by bumping up the protein with a small amount of semolina or even bread flour. Mostly a personal preference there for firmer pasta. Similarly, if we’re working with something that’s got that good strong gluten but isn’t super elastic (like wholemeal flour) or even something without gluten (like cocoa) we might add some 00 to take it in the other direction and make it easier to shape. Often, the protein, gluten strength, and elasticity that we’re trying to achieve by ‘balancing’ those flours is very similar to that of unbleached all-purpose. So, if you’re ever stuck without whatever random flour we’re using in our recipes, you can always replace the whole flour component with all-purpose. This week, we’re saving you the trouble! Because we hypothetically ran out of flour options too…",
            "Fire up the oven and toss the potatoes and fennel in before you get started on the dough. They’ll roast for about 45 minutes, with the fennel benefitting from an occasional toss. Once they’re done, peel and rice the potatoes while still warm, and blend them up with the fennel. That’s your filling done. We highly recommend hanging on to those skins too. Just drizzle them with a little more oil, sprinkle with salt, and shove them back in the oven for a few minutes until crispy.",
            "To make the dough, mound up the flour and ground fennel seed into a well, and crack the eggs into the middle. Stir it all up, knead it around wildly for 10 minutes, and then rest it for 30. Since I’ve already gotten going on the gluten thing… Make sure that you don’t skimp on the knead time. This is really where you develop the gluten bonds that will grant you exceptional, silky, malleable dough. I normally notice a change in the dough around the 7 minute mark, then give it another 3 for good luck.",
            "We’ve used a stunning ravioli mould from 44 Hand Made Turkey to stamp our cappelletti this week. It’s not a typical use for one of these things, but added a fun bit of detail to the pasta. We decided to leave our dough a little thicker than usual to maximise the texture from the stamp: so roll it incrementally through to a setting of 5 or 6 (on a 9-setting machine). Stamp out your circles and then press and fill on the moulds one at a time, if using them. Otherwise just squeeze a dollop onto every circle and get folding.",
            "To form the cappelletti, simply bring one corner around the filling to overlap slightly with the other corner, and pinch them together firmly where they meet. Give them a firm poke in the side of the filling if you’re having trouble with that last fold.",
            "Boil your cappelletti in a big salty pot of water, remembering that a thicker dough will really blow out that cook time. Then serve them up with a very generous glug of agrumato, those crispy potato skins, and a few crushed pink peppercorns.",

            "We’ve been making all kinds of creative pasta lately, with unusual ingredient lists, playful dough colourings, and fiddly shapes. Well, this week we’re going back to basics, and cooking up a crowd-pleasing carbonara. To add a little Pasta et Al spin, we’ve made our tonnarelli with half rye flour, and smoked it briefly before tossing it through the sauce. It’s a creamy, cheesy, smoky smile-bringer.",
            "It’s also one of those great meals that’s quick to pull together, particularly if you’ve already got your pasta ready, but takes just enough finesse to make it special. It lifted our lockdown spirits, and we hope that it brings you a little classic pasta joy too.",
            "Apart from half of the flour being rye, this is a straightforward 100g flour to 1 egg kind of dough. The rye adds a little earthiness that works well with the smoke, but you can stick to all plain flour and it’ll still turn out pretty good. Form a flour well with the eggs in the middle, mix it all together and knead vigorously for 10 minutes, then seal it up and rest for 30.",
            "Roll the pasta out nice and thick – if you’re using a 9-setting machine, step it through to a 5. Then cut it into sheets of around 30cm, and get chopping.",
            "You’ll know by now that we’re kind of obsessed with the chitarra, and the amazing sharp edges that it gives to your pasta. If you don’t have one though, hand cutting your pasta with a sharp knife will give you a similar result.",
            "Next, get started on the sauce. The clock’s ticking once it hits the heat, so prep as much as you can in advance. Mix together the eggs, yolks, cheese, and pepper, and then fry up the prosciutto while you bring a big old pot of water to the boil.",
            "Boil the tonnarelli for 2-3 minutes; ensure that’s it cooked, without any raw dough showing if you cut into it, but still firm. Drain, retaining the pasta water. Light your woodchips, and then use a grilling rack to lay the pasta over them. Seal it up and let it smoke for 5-6 minutes. We just used two aluminium roasting trays with a grilling rack in the middle, clamped shut with stainless steel pegs.",
            "While that’s smoking, use the same pan from the prosciutto to fry the pancetta, and rest a large stainless steel mixing bowl over the filled pot that you boiled the pasta in. You want to heat the bowl up enough to gently combine the sauce with the pasta, without scrambling your eggs.",
            "Drop the freshly smoked tonnarelli into the pancetta pan, toss it through for a minute or so on medium-high heat, and then transfer it to the mixing bowl. Slowly pour the egg mix in, stirring vigorously to avoid clumping, and adding a little retained pasta water if it seems too dry, Alternatively, you can allow that pancetta pan to cool down a bit, then just combine everything in there.",

        "content": [
            "Selamat pagi para pemasak dan para pecinta makanan! This week we’ve crafted something extra special and delightfully different, a fusion of cuisines that is particularly close to my heart. And is quite possibly one of the tastiest things that I’ve ever cooked! My roots might be in Italy, and my home in Australia, but Indonesia is where I really grew into myself. So I’m very excited to present our latest creation: fagottini made with cassava leaf dough and cooked as potstickers, filled with slow-cooked beef rendang, and served with green sambal, chilli eggplant, and toasted coconut.",
            "I was lucky to grow up only a few hours’ from Indonesia, by plane. For our international friends, these days it takes me almost twice as long to fly from Canberra back to Perth. As a result, not only were our holidays fantastic, but the Indonesian community in Perth was large, and I spent about 10 of my school years learning Indonesian. It was therefore only natural that I continue on my language studies to university; by which I mean the Indonesian lecturers cut me a deal to drop my visual arts degree in exchange for an express ticket to fourth year level Indonesian classes, and Yogyakarta.",
            "Yogya is still a special place to me, even though my time at university there was short (I specialised in ancient Indonesian history, linguistics, and a little bit of gong playing in the uni’s traditional orchestra). I was 19 and straight out of home, with a very open mind and street slang respectable enough to grant me an instant band of local troublemakers and a complementary agenda of local mischief. I guess that it was my coming of age, and so from that point on Indonesia has been as closely tied to who I am as Italy is.",
            "It should come as no surprise that a big part of the Indonesian experience for me is the food. Indonesia is incredibly diverse, with over 1300 distinct ethnicities spread over more than 6000 inhabited islands. The language itself, commonly referred to as Bahasa Indonesia, was only formalised in the 40s as a lingua franca to try and unite speakers of over 700 local languages. And with all of that diversity comes a whole lot of food. Though it’s hard to pick a favourite cuisine, and I enjoy just about anything from across the archipelago, Padang food (or Minang food as it’s locally known) has always stood out to me. All I can say is the Minangkabau people, of West Sumatra, sure know how to cook.",
            "Generally speaking, think chillies, coconut milk, and more chillies. And a whole lot of food. If you go to a Padang restaurant, prepare yourself for an onslaught of literally dozens of dishes. Stews, soups, thick curries, thin curries, fried things, grilled things, fish, eggs, beef, beans, chicken, breads, rice. I could name at least 50 different items without slowing down. You don’t order, just grab a seat, wait for the plates to come to you, and then only pay for what you eat. If you ever get the chance, visit a Padang restaurant! It is an incredible food experience.",
            "For all of the climbing active volcanoes, racing scooters across rice fields, scuba diving, pinching something from a farmer’s field to roast as a midnight snack, flirting, having babies thrust at me for photo opportunities, growing out my hair, and that one time that a stranger asked me to play a Ronan Keating song at his wedding, one of the true highlights for me was my weekly Padang takeaway. A couple of pieces of rendang (beef stewed until dry in coconut milk and spices), gulai nangka muda (light curry of young jackfruit), daun singkong (cassava leaves, boiled or in a light curry), sambal ijo (fiery but fresh green chilli sauce), and some rice. Give or take a few things depending on my mood. All wrapped up in a big banana leaf, ‘dibungkus’, for about $1.",
            "So this week’s dish is a play on that delicious little bundle. We’ve taken the rendang (with a recipe that I’ve fine-tuned over almost 20 years), and wrapped it up in little pasta potstickers made with cassava leaf. These are served with a classic green sambal, and another wonderful Padang dish terong balado, or eggplant with chilli. With a scattering of toasted coconut, and in an ode to student me sitting down in my tiny room to tuck in, it’s all plated up on banana leaves. Let’s cook!",
            "Look at this collection of ingredients! It’s incredible to think of the things that you can now pop down the road to collect, compared to even 10 years ago.",
            "Most of these bits and pieces are going into the rendang that we used to fill our pasta, and that takes about 5 hours to cook, so it’s a good place to start. If it helps with timing, you can make it a few days in advance and keep it in the fridge. We also cooked up about four times as much rendang as we needed to fill the pasta, then froze the rest for future us to have as a traditional curry. So anyway, blend up your paste, a little bit at a time if your food processor struggles with the coarser ingredients, and then fry it gently in oil before adding the meat. Toss in the rest of the sauce ingredients, and cook it partially covered until it’s dried right out. Note that to prevent it being too dry as a filling, we left it a little wetter than usual.",
            "As that’s cooking, get started on your pasta dough, and the two side dishes. While our potstickers are technically made with a pasta dough and as a pasta shape, the Italian influence ends there. For this dough, we’ve taken a classic green fettuccine recipe, and swapped the spinach for cassava leaves. Make sure that you cook these leaves well, for at least 10 minutes on a vigorous boil, as raw cassava roots and leaves are extremely harmful if ingested. If you can’t find cassava leaves, substitute for kale or just stick with spinach. Blend up your dough in a food processor to distribute the colour evenly, and then knead for 10 minutes before resting for at least 30.",
            "Onto the chilli eggplant. This is a fairly straightforward job. Just slice the eggplant into thin rounds and steam for 20 minutes. While that’s cooking away, blend together the chillies, shallots, garlic, and tomatoes, and fry for 5-8 minutes with the torn lime leaves. Toss it all together, and you’re done.",
            "The green sambal is similarly easy, although we decided to add in a step by fire roasting the chillies first. This gave them a delicious bit of smokiness, and gave little Al a good opportunity to test his tong skills. Turns out he’s kind of a big deal in the tong world.",
            "Seal them in a bag for 10 minutes to loosen the skin before peeling. If you’re not roasting them, steam the chillies, shallots, green tomatoes, garlic, and lemongrass, and then smash it all up into a coarse paste. Fry this with the lime leaves for 10 minutes to finish.",
            "Finally, back to the pasta. Roll it out to a medium thickness (we used a setting of 5 on a 9-setting machine) and then cut it into 10cm squares. Mash up the rendang, and then spoon a walnut-sized piece into the centre of each square.",
            "To fold, gently draw the corners together to meet lightly above the filling, and then carefully seal the edges together to form little square-based pyramids.",
            "Heat up an oiled pan to medium-high, and then fry them in small batches for about 3 minutes or until the undersides are crispy and brown. Pour in about half a cup of water, then cover and cook for another 4-5 minutes. Perfection!",
            "Plate it all up with a sprinkle of toasted shredded coconut, and get stuck in!",
            "Everything that we make on Pasta et Al is made with love, but this is a particularly personal dish. I’m really excited to have created something new like this from the foods that I love the most, and it’s so good to be sharing it with this wonderful community of passionate cooks and food lovers. Even if it is pushing the bounds of ‘pasta’ a little…",

        "content": [
            "Ah, rigatoni. For all of the incredible shapes and fillings out there, all of the carefully handcrafted pasta that we obsess over, there’s just something indescribably special about these chewy, ridged, extruded tubes. Even as a kid, I remember secretly hanging out for the dried supermarket rigatoni, despite always having a freezer full of fresh pasta. A big bowl of rigatoni with thick tomato sauce and a huge mound of grated cheese can fix just about anything.",
            "Even though we love our extruded pasta, and have posted a few recipes before on social media, this is actually the first time that we’ve featured one on our blog. Rest assured, this dough recipe always works for us, for any extruded pasta, so we’re excited to be sharing it with you now! That said, if you ever have any difficulties with our recipes, get in touch and we’ll problem-solve together.",
            "Now, rigatoni deserves a good sauce; one that can cling to and fill the pasta, and of course be loaded with outrageous amounts of grated cheese. So, based off one of our earliest blog posts, the family favourite sugo, this week’s rigatoni is served with a thick tomato sauce and veal and eggplant meatballs. The smell of a rich sauce cooking all day is hard to beat, but there is something magic about the smell of that sauce meeting a fresh bowl of pasta. With cheese on top. Perfection.",
            "Yes, despite definitely not enforcing it, we do actually eat our meatballs as a second course. Or at least, on the side with veggies. They just look so good nestled up alongside a hearty bowl of pasta that it’s hard to resist plating them together.",
            "Finally, don’t stress if you don’t have a pasta extruder. We don’t want to exclude anyone here! Try checking out our tortiglioni recipe for a handmade alternative, or really pick any other pasta of ours – it’s hard to find a variety that won’t pair nicely with a classic tomato sauce!",
            "Forget what you know about pasta dough! Or at least, non-extruded pasta dough. The key to success with an extruded dough is keeping it crumbly, although still moist enough to compress into little balls. To achieve this, we always measure our water on top of our eggs. That is, the eggs make up some of the ‘water’ volume. Gradually add the egg and water as you crumble the dough together with your hands, until it clings together a bit like breadcrumbs and butter. It should hold when pinched together between your fingers. Rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes, and stick the extruder plate in there too. This just helps to prevent the dough clogging everything up as the machine starts to warm.",
            "Drop the dough into the extruder in roughly walnut sized balls, and chop it off at rigatoni length (about 45-50mm). Note that some extruders will take a few minutes to get going after the first lumps of dough are added in. Dry your rigatoni out in the fridge for up to a week, or cook and eat immediately. Lightly salted water, high boil, until no raw (white) dough is visible when you chomp into them.",
            "For the sauce, roast the eggplants and discard the skin, then mix them in with the other meatball ingredients. Get your fingers in there and work it to a smooth, even consistency! The eggplants may really change the moisture level of the meatballs, so be prepared to add more or less breadcrumbs.",
            "Next up, the good old soffritto. Do not rush this bit! The soffritto is the heart of the dish. Cook it slowly, on low heat, stirring regularly, before you add in the basil and passata. Once the sauce is bubbling, drop in the meatballs, lower the heat, and cook mostly covered for at least 3 hours. For the first couple of stirs, try to shuffle the pot instead of sticking a wooden spoon in there. These meatballs are particularly soft, and need a few minutes to compose themselves.",
            "Once reduced to your liking, scoop out the meatballs and stir in the cooked pasta. Serve with a whole heap of grated cheese. Enough to not even see what you’ve spent all that time cooking.",
            "Thank you so much for joining us again this week. May the smell of slow-cooked tomatoes fill your house, and firm sauce-filled pasta fill your belly.",

            "Back before parenthood and pandemic, when we were able to fly around the world, or jump in the car on a whim and just drive, I’d get to the ocean as often as I could. Any long-term followers might recall that I have a particular obsession with photographing tiny underwater things, and for a while there I was diving almost every weekend. I was quicker at jumping into a wetsuit and slinging on a tank than pulling on my socks and shoes. Alas, I’ve been largely confined to land for the past couple of years, though I find myself often dreaming of the alien shapes and colours waiting out there under the waves.",
            "A while back we made some tequila prawn sacchettoni with blue spirulina, all plated up like anemones in a rock pool. In a similar vein, I wanted this week’s tagliolini to look like something you’d see as you descend those first few metres on a rock wall. Maybe some sort of feather star hunkered down after you’ve bothered it. Note: please don’t deliberately bother feather stars.",
            "With squid ink to colour half of our pasta, it made sense to feature some fishy stuff (yes, technically crustaceany stuff) for the final dish. So little Al selected some fine looking blue swimmer crabs, or blue manna as we used to call them back home, to form the basis for our sauce. The other half of our pasta is flavoured with good old Aussie saltbush, and we couldn’t resist teaming this up with a generous and colourful handful of finger lime.",
            "So get into it! This is our saltbush and squid ink tagliolini with crab and finger lime, combining the zesty freshness of lime with the sweetness of crab and the saltiness of the sea. An Aussie flavoured take on a classic pasta dish.",
            "It’s two-toning time; a bit like our squid ink and lemon linguine, but striped instead of double-sided. So to start off with, mix up two doughs! For an Aussie theme, we’ve added some saltbush into our lighter dough. This is one of my favourite native ingredients, and also one of the easiest to source, particularly dried. It’s a true flavour enhancer for just about anything that you’d normally add salt to.",
            "Once you’ve kneaded, rested, and sheeted both doughs, cut the saltbush pasta into fettuccine and then lay it in strips perpendicularly across the squid ink sheets. Give the saltbush sheets a light spritz of water if there’s no tackiness there. You can lay the fettuccine side by side with no gap in between, as the final laminated roll will naturally spread them apart a little. This really doesn’t need to be precise, as you won’t notice any wonkiness in the final cut pasta!",
            "Tidy up the edges, and then give the sheets a light roll or pass them back through the pasta machine on a slightly thicker setting, stepping back up by one or two stops if desired. Finally, use a machine cutter or a sharp knife and many cuts to form your sheets into tagliolini. If not using immediately, toss them lightly in flour and refrigerate uncovered for up to one week.",
            "Our sauce is nice and simple this week. Just boil up your crabs, chill them out in icy water, and crack out all of the flesh. Fry up the chilli and garlic, then add in the crab and all the other sauce ingredients. Try not to get distracted tasting the finger limes. They’re a seriously delicious blend of familiar citrus and familiar bushland, and snacking on them added a good 15 minutes to my cook time.",
            "Toss in your cooked pasta, plate it up in a twist for that aquatic vibe, and finish with a little more finger lime and salt flakes.",

            "It’s time to go back to basics, and it doesn’t get much simpler than flour, water, and onions. This week we’re tapping into our roots with the perfectly imperfect Calabrese fileja. Although we make all kinds of pasta these days, and tend to use egg doughs more often than not, a lot of the pasta that we made and ate growing up was just flour and water. In fact, most of the food that we enjoyed was really cucina povera, imported to Australia relatively unchanged from how it was cooked by generations before us back in Italy. For me, something about that connection always makes these dishes a little special.",
            "Yes, I’ll say it upfront: it’s not the prettiest plate, and it is one of those meals made with whatever’s available in the kitchen and garden (despite originally using the famous Tropea onion, we could only ever find and cook this with brown ones). But because of that, it’s one of the dishes that keeps me firmly connected to my past. I’m so fortunate for the life and family that I have now, and I’ve always carried at the front of my mind the stories of struggle and sacrifice that granted me this life. But there’s something about cucina povera that goes deeper. It evokes memories that aren’t my own. It makes me think of my bisnonna dressing as a man so that she could go and earn money clearing rocks from the fields; it makes me think about my Nonno stepping off the boat in Fremantle. My mum, the first born here in Australia, facing racism, sexism, having to justify why she should have an education. All of those people who struggled before me. These dishes embrace the same simplicity that gives us hope and joy at those hardest of times. The pasta is inconsistent and ragged, the sauce has three ingredients, four if you really want to splash out. But because of that it’s cooked and shared with such deep love and purpose. So while we love us a bit of fancy pasta, this week’s dish is something that truly comes from the heart.",
            "In that tradition of making do, we’ve prepared our fileja with a mix of semolina and dark rye flour, because that’s what we had lying around! And although it wasn’t deliberate, it occurred to me as I was kneading the dough that I didn’t have a knitting needle to form them with, so little Al lent me his pliers and we raided the cupboard for a coat hanger to snip up.",
            "Our sauce is made with regular red onions, which are a vague approximation of the Tropea onions that this dish is based on. Contrary to popular belief, red onion varieties don’t necessarily have more sugar in them compared to white and brown, but their lower level of pyruvic acid does allow the sweetness to shine through more. Cooking them up with a little white wine and garlic, then adding in some salty hard cheese at the end makes for a delicious, comforting, and subtle balance of flavours.",
            "Once you’ve finished ransacking drawers for skewers or knitting needles, pillaging cupboards for coathangers, or snapping aerials off the cars of those neighbours you never really liked anyway, form a flour well and pour in your water. Note that this pasta benefits from being a little on the dry side.",
            "After the dough’s rested, roll it into long ropes, chop it into short lengths, and then drape and roll it around the skewer.",
            "To get that imperfect, slightly open appearance, drape it loosely and use your fingertips to gently roll it back and forwards. If you’re too fastidious, you’ll end up with bucatini!",
            "For the sauce, sweat the onions with the garlic for a few minutes, before adding the wine and cooking covered for 20. Grate in the cheese, drop in your cooked fileja (lifted straight from the pot without draining), and give it a good toss. Plate it up with a heap of cheese and a crack of pepper!",
            "This is a really simple and forgiving recipe, and a great pasta to make with the whole family. So grab everyone you can, and get in the kitchen!",

This weekend though my inspiration had run dry. Life’s been busy and days have been long. I’ve just been trying to get up that great big hill of hope for a destination.",
            "It was clear that I needed a brief retreat into my angsty early teens. A few days 20 years back with tazos, morning television, and superstars and cannonballs running through my head. Given, however, the inherent risk of temporal paradox and a tendency to fix things with pasta, this week we’re serving up 90s print triangoli.",
            "This retro pasta gets its colour from turmeric, black cocoa, blue spirulina, and freeze-dried beetroot. We’ve filled them up with ricotta and a hit of dried saltbush, for an Aussie touch, and served them simply tossed in a little brown butter.",
            "Now, first up, you don’t need to do this with four different types of dough. In fact, you could make it without any lamination at all. There’s nothing wrong with sticking to the rivers and the lakes that you’re used to. But if you’re up for the challenge, start by mixing the flours together and forming four wells on your benchtop. We used two thirds of the weight for the main turmeric dough, and then split the rest for the remaining three. Gently whisk together the eggs, then pour them into the centres of your wells with the same ratio as the flour (it will be half the weight of the flour in each well). Cocoa and turmeric tend to be a bit ‘thirsty’, so you may need to add a little water as you bring those doughs together. Work each of the wells into shaggy masses and then knead for 7-10 minutes, or until they feel elastic and soft. Rest for 30 minutes, away from heat and direct sunlight. Also rest the dough.",
            "While you wait, mix together all of your filling ingredients with a fork. It should be fairly smooth but still hold together enough for you to break into chunks and pinch together between your fingers.",
            "Next, roll all of those doughs out to a medium-thin thickness. We used a 9-setting pasta machine and stepped them all incrementally through to 6, apart from the cocoa dough that we rolled a little thinner to 7. The cocoa is mostly used underneath other laminated doughs, so this will help to minimise the overall thickness in those areas.",
            "Cut the spirulina and beetroot doughs into triangles, and the cocoa dough half into triangles, half into rectangles. If you have a thin (3-4cm wide) ruler, you can just flip that long edge over long edge, pressing down lightly to mark horizontal and vertical lines. Then use a straight roller cutter to form squares, before cutting across at diagonals to halve them into triangles. For the rectangles, cut fettuccine-width pieces of pasta, and then chop them into short lengths.",
            "Now it’s time to get artistic. We started with the cocoa shapes, before layering slightly offset spirulina and beetroot triangles over the cocoa triangles. With all of these shapes to cut and stick, you’ll need to carefully manage your dough moisture. I’m sure you’ve heard it all before, but you never really had a doubt that you’ll need to seal everything that you’re not working on top and bottom with cling wrap, and lightly spritz the air over any exposed dough to keep it soft and tacky enough for lamination. If it gets too sticky or stretchy, just leave it uncovered to dry out for a few minutes before handling further. Just keep feeling your pasta as you work.",
            "Once all of your shapes are arranged, dust both sides with semolina and then either roll it gently with a pin, or pass it back through the pasta machine rollers at a setting just wide enough to provide light compression. For us, this was a machine setting of 3.",
            "Lay the sheets face down and then cut squares of 6cm. Drop a big grape-sized dollop of filling onto each and then fold in half to form triangles. Press gently to seal, and then trim the joined edges using a rolling pasta cutter. If you want a little zigazig ah.",
            "As always, cook in a large pot of lightly salted boiling water until al dente; firm, but with no raw dough showing when it’s cut into. I don’t care who you are, where you’re from, what you did, as long as you don’t overcook your pasta.",
            "To serve, simply melt the butter with the garlic gloves over low-medium heat until the butter begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Skim off the solids or pour it all through a sieve to remove them, and discard (eat) the garlic cloves. For an alternative butter sauce, check out our recipe for brown butter with pink peppercorns and lemon thyme!",
            "Then just toss the drained pasta in the butter, plate on up, and enjoy a carby bowl of fine-patterned 90s nostalgia.",

            "For an easy finishing touch, to contrast with all that chewy softness (and last week’s white beans), we’ve roasted a big handful of black beans in chilli and oil. They look just like they’ve popped out of our pasta pods.",
            "Any pasta making’s a good opportunity to get varied and tiny hands involved, but this one is particularly perfect. It’s like playdough, but you can eat it. Without getting a stomach ache or a talking-to.",
            "Quick and easy. Just mix your flours together in a large bowl or clean benchtop, and then gradually add the water as you bring it together with your hand. Once it holds together in a shaggy mass, without sticking to anything, knead it vigorously for 10 minutes. If it’s too wet, just add a little more flour. Once kneaded, seal it in cling wrap and leave it to rest for 30 minutes, away from heat and direct sunlight.",
            "Next, roll the dough out into long thin sausages of around 1cm diameter, and chop them up into lengths of 4-5cm. Use the fingertips of your middle three fingers to make indentations along the length of each piece, pushing down and drawing gently towards yourself. If the dough slides around too much, give it a very light spritz of water; if it’s too sticky, add a little flour to your work surface. Transfer them to lightly floured baking paper lined trays as they’re formed, and refrigerate uncovered for up to one week. You can also drop them straight into the freezer.",
            "To cook the broccoli, add around one inch of water to a large pot with a ¼ tsp of baking soda, and a pinch of salt. The baking soda will help the broccoli break down easier, and make for a nice smooth purée when blended. No little bits of floret, no brown discoloration because you had to cook it forever! Add the broccoli, and give it 6-8 minutes, then drain and stick it into the food processor or blender still warm, along with the other purée ingredients. Blitz until smooth.",
            "Finally, those crunchy beans. Just toss them in the oil with the chilli and salt, and roast in a 200 degrees Celsius oven for 30-40 minutes.",
            "The capunti will only take a few minutes to cook, so plonk them into a large pot of lightly salted and vigorously boiling water, and wait for them to surface. Let them bob around for a bit, and then cut (bite) across one to check that there’s no white raw dough. Drain, toss through the purée, and serve with the black beans sprinkled on top.",

            "We’re finally, reluctantly, ready to accept that the temperature’s cooling down for another year. At least where we are. And that means that it’s time for some seasonal pasta. This week we’ve got beetroot-striped beef cappelletti, sitting on top of a thick white bean and roasted garlic purée, with some cute roasted baby root vegetables alongside. Yep, it’s roast-themed pasta! And it’s seriously delicious.",
            "While my Ma’s family is thoroughly Italian, my Dad’s is classic English-Australian. And of course that poor lot are often overlooked in a blog about pasta. So we’re dedicating this meat and roast veg pasta to the old man. It’s probably the closest that we’ll get to an English meal, but you never know, maybe we just haven’t given it enough thought yet!",
            "You might remember our cocoa-striped cappelletti from Instagram a while back. They were so popular that we’ve decided to show you how it’s done. Firstly though, quick note: the stripes are really just visual, and in fact even if all of the dough was made with beetroot it’s a subtle and difficult flavour to discern after cooking. But the technique in this recipe is a simple way to doodle on your pasta, and there’s no reason why you can’t substitute that added flavour with a punchier dough like that of our spinach and paprika funghini, or our wild olive pappardelle. Otherwise, we do eat with our eyes as well as our mouths, so get creative and get stripey.",
            "First up, you’ll need two doughs. We find it easiest to mix it all up plain, and then break off about a third and add the freeze-dried beetroot powder into that. As always, don’t cut short the kneading time. Ten minutes of firm kneading then half an hour to rest, all wrapped up and away from any heat or sun.",
            "While the pasta relaxes, prepare the filling. As noted in the recipe card, we used some of the leftover meat from the latest batch of our pressure cooker bone broth. If you don’t have similar leftovers to rework, just quickly fry up a bit of beef mince. Then pulse that in a food processor with the ricotta and pecorino. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and you’re ready to go.",
            "Next, roll all of that pasta out into sheets, and then cut the beetroot dough into thin strands, about the width of thick spaghetti. After last week’s chitarra excitement, you’re probably not surprised to learn that that’s how we cut ours. But a machine attachment or a good old knife works just fine too.",
            "Spritz the plain dough lightly, and then get artsy. Try to use a little tension to keep the beetroot pasta flat as you lay it out, avoiding too many overlaps. Once you’re done, lightly flour the top, and then turn the sheet over. Roll firmly with a rolling pin, but try to avoid stretching the dough too much. This form of lamination will give you a slightly inconsistent pasta thickness, which can be an issue when it comes to cooking, however we try to cover a lot of area with the second layer, and then press it down a bit with that pin. Just be sure to cook your pasta to suit the thickest parts, and it’ll taste great.",
            "Cut or stamp out 7-8cm circles, plop a big teaspoon of filling in the centre, and then turn them into cappelletti. Just fold them in half, seal them into neat little semicircles, and give them a poke in the belly towards that outer curved edge. Bring the corners around the filling to overlap slightly and pinch lightly to complete the shape.",
            "Now, how cute are these stumpy veggies? Stick them in a covered oven dish with a splash of water, and roast them for about 40 minutes.",
            "Remove the skins, toss them in butter, oil, and rosemary, and finish them off uncovered in the oven for another 25-30. Don’t forget to chuck the garlic into the oven at some point.",
            "While all of that’s going on, you can prepare your beans. It’s such a simple thing, but so satisfying. Just be sure to not drain them – all of that juicy stuff they’re sitting in will thicken up the purée nicely. If it’s too runny after blending, just keep adding cheese!",
            "Cook your pasta to al dente in a big pot of lightly salted boiling water, then choose your own plating adventure. To photograph, we tossed the cappelletti in oil and then carefully sat them up on the purée, surrounded by the vegetables. Crack of pepper on top. To eat, we threw everything into one big bowl and stirred it around wildly until everything was evenly coated.",
            "And that’s it. These are fantastic flavours and textures for a chilly evening, sure to fill your belly and make you smile.",

        "content": [
            "This week we’re bringing you a family classic, a simple and delicious dish that was on regular rotation when I was a kid. Tuna and capsicum pasta can be as straightforward as a couple of capsicums, a tin of tuna, and some dried pasta. Despite this simplicity, or perhaps because of it, it makes for an unexpectedly satisfying meal and a perfect option for a quick dinner.",
            "Now there’s nothing wrong with using some good old tinned fish, but we’re suckers for punishment (and homemade food) so we’ve made our own tuna in oil this week. It’s not truly preserved, but will last in the fridge for around 2 weeks before you should get suspicious of it. So if you come across a good chunk of tuna in your travels, remember this recipe: boil and oil.",
            "Finally, we’re very excited to be featuring our chitarra this week. We actually use it a lot because there’s something special about the pasta edges that it produces. It’s a sharp, right-angled cut that you can’t replicate with a knife or cutter, and it is just so good to munch on. Credit where it’s due, those Abruzzesi sure know how to cut their pasta. Of course, if you don’t own one of these guitar-stringed gadgets, you can substitute with any other long pasta. We often had it with linguine, which has a similar bite.",
            "First off, the tuna! This is as simple as it is rewarding, but if you don’t have 3 odd hours of prep time available grab a tin or two from the cupboard and skip to the next stage. Add the salt into the water and bring to the boil, then trim any skin and dark flesh off the tuna before dropping it in. Lower the heat and gently simmer for 1.5-2 hours, before removing and draining. If you’d like it extra firm, stick it in an airtight container in the fridge over night to completely dry out. Then cut it into large chunks, jar it up, and completely submerge it with oil. As you dip into your tuna supplies over the next fortnight, make sure that it goes back into the fridge each time covered over with oil.",
            "We’re making a similarly simple pasta dough today – pretty much an egg for every 100g of flour. As a quick reminder, we use large eggs for our recipes so if you’re cooking with smaller ones and find that the dough is too dry as it comes together, gradually add water (no more than 1tbsp at a time) until it is soft but not sticking to your hands or work surface. We’d provide our egg measurements in grams, but it’s a little impractical for a simple Sunday pasta, and potentially a bit wasteful. So as always with pasta, start with a recipe, but then feel your way through it!",
            "Once you’ve mixed it all together in your flour well, give it a vigorous knead for 10 minutes and then rest it for 30. Now’s a great time to get those capsicums going. Start the garlic off in the oil, then cut the capsicums into thin strips and add them in with a little seasoning. Cook covered on low heat for 45 minutes.",
            "Back to the chitarra. Tighten up those strings, serenade your lover or bemused toddler, and roll out that pasta dough. We went for a medium-thin thickness (6 on a 9-setting machine) but you can go thicker – this pasta is well suited to it. If you’re on a machine, give it a few turns on the thickest setting folding over itself in between passes, and then incrementally step it through to your final thickness.",
            "Cut the sheets into lengths of around 30cm, lay them across the chitarra, and roll firmly with a pin (the motion is actually more of a drag than a roll). We use an empty, de-labelled wine bottle ourselves to avoid scratching up our rolling pin. As it’s cut, the pasta will drop through onto the tray underneath; once it has all fallen through, just tilt the chitarra on its side, and scoop up all that fine-looking pasta.",
            "If you’re eating immediately, pop it into a large pot of boiling and lightly salted water, and cook until al dente. If not, toss gently with a little flour and refrigerate uncovered for up to one week.",
            "To serve, crumble the tuna into the capsicums, add in the drained pasta (with a little pasta water if needed to help emulsification), and plate it up.",

            "Tomato day. This week it’s something so exciting and close to my heart that it was hard knowing where to start. In fact, it’s so deeply enmeshed with who I am that I juggled joy and a hard lump in my throat as I tried to put it into words. After almost two decades, we’re bringing back tomato day!",
            "Throughout a childhood of being asked whether we made tomato sauce, our little band of cousins has become pretty good at joking summaries of days spent sitting around on milk crates with paring knives, Nonna ordering everyone about in her little knotted handkerchief hat. It’s hilarious and we’re proud of it, but it’s also easier than trying to express what it actually means to us. Particularly now that we’ve all grown up and set off on our own lives.",
            "For me at least, those were times of such intense happiness and belonging that rarely a day goes by without me wishing I could live even one of those moments again. There was my Bisnonna (‘Big Nonna’) in charge of the whole thing with my Nonna second-in-command, my Ma and her brother and sister, all of us cousins, and occasionally a slightly baffled outsider. There was scheming with a carefully chosen farmer, entrusted with the task of growing our family tomatoes, and the days leading up to the big event where Nonna would keep the tomatoes spread across a bed sheet on her garage floor to finish ripening. 5am starts, endless coffee and regimented break times, freshly picked basil taken straight from the garden to drop into each bottle, that perfect smell of salted tomatoes alongside engine grease and firewood. And of course enough dark brown beer bottles, recollected as they were used over the previous year, to fill and distribute to the whole family for another twelve months. Every time any of us plucked one of those bottles out of its cool, dark hiding spot to cook with, we were immediately taken back to that day in Nonna’s garage.",
            "Danica and I are the oldest of the cousins, and we’re over here by ourselves on the other side of the country. In the time that I’ve been here, more than a third of my life now, that first generation who passed on the food traditions that we celebrate today has all but disappeared. The overseers of the sauce, the bosses of the pasta, the masters of the spit roast, the holders of all biscuit and pastry secrets. Almost all of them have now passed away, or forgotten us. So I do write this with a profound sense of loss. Tomato day, particularly this time around, is not just about the tomatoes: it’s about acknowledging the end of something intangibly momentous, one of the deepest parts of my identity losing the people that tied it to the physical world. It turns out that reviving an old tradition adds a painful finality to what came before.",
            "However, the immutable beauty of food traditions is that they’re ultimately things of love. For all of the sadness and loss, there will always be greater amounts of happiness and hope. The old generation may be missing, but there’s a new one this time around. In fact, hot off the press, little Al actually has a little brother on the way. I haven’t been this happy on tomato day since I graduated from tomato-washing to bottle-capping. Though the blog may need rebranding.",
            "It goes without saying that it all begins and ends with the tomato. I was never privy to the research, planning, and negotiation that went into the seemingly simple act of purchasing a trailer-load of tomatoes, so I’ve blindly inherited only the panic and obsession, which I now gift onwards to my grocer. After searching high and low, I ended up back at one of my first and favourite grocers from when I first moved over east, Trugolds. I remember good old Fred used to stand out the front yelling about Fuji apples and offering a slice or two with a flattering comment about how good I was looking that weekend. I used to eat a lot of Fuji apples.",
            "Offering a niche product like this takes a lot of understanding and care from the grocer. Not to mention a willingness to face hordes of picky Italians descending on you and your tomatoes each summer. Long story short, history repeated itself, and I was an unintentional nuisance to deal with, but Tony and the crew nonetheless went out of their way to make our tomato day happen. And look at these fine things. Vine-ripened, thin-skinned Roma goodness. Specially sourced from Shepparton in Victoria, and ready for only one month a year.",
            "Now, first things first: prime your coffee machine, because you’ll need to be up before the sun. First step is to clean the tomatoes, and then cut off and discard the tops, any bad bits, and the watery cores. This will take longer than expected, and you’ll come to realise that you make passata for the heart more than the stomach.",
            "Line some large tubs with cheesecloths (or for a more traditional approach like us, bed sheets) and then load up the tomatoes with a sprinkling of salt between layers. For us, that’s about 1tbsp per kilogram. Leave them for 2-3 hours, allowing the salt to draw out as much moisture as possible, then bundle up the sheets and firmly wring out any remaining water.",
            "Next, crack out the tomato machine and pass the skins through 5-6 times. Make sure that you never let the machine run dry, and chuck the skins to the chooks.",
            "Full disclosure, our chooks retired a few decades ago.",
            "There are many ways to sterilise your bottles, but we work in small batches, handwashing them with hot soapy water then drying them in the oven for 15-20 minutes before bottling. A few minutes in boiled kettle water for the caps.",
            "Drop a large leaf of basil into the bottom of each bottle, then fill and cap leaving some space in the neck for the sauce to expand as it heats. Use hessian sacks or thick towels to layer them into a large stock pot/s (the sacks will prevent them knocking together and shattering) set over a 3-4 ring burner, submerge with cold water, and bring slowly to a gentle boil. We used to cook them in 44 gallon drums over a mound of wood, but memories of my uncle running out the front every half an hour to check whether any smoke was visible from the road suggest that it’s less legally ambiguous to use gas during Australian bushfire season.",
            "They’ll need to be in there for 4-6 hours, so keep an eye on the boil and make sure it doesn’t get too excited. Turn off the heat and allow the pots to cool overnight before lifting the bottles out. Store this red gold away in a cool, dark location, bask in the glory of what you’ve achieved, and treat yourself to an early dinner with any leftover tomatoes.",

It’s been a while since we featured a good old ragu, so this week we’re cooking up a pot of short ribs. Nothing tricky, nothing fancy, just a nice long sit in the oven.",

For our take on it, we’ve swapped the steak for short ribs, and stuck those olives into the pasta dough instead of the sauce. Because why not? Make sure you check out our accompanying wild olive pappardelle right here!",

This is arguably the most important part of the whole thing, so take your time and let those onions sweat it out until they turn translucent. Stir regularly.",

            "The hard part now is the kitchen mastery required to lift the ribs out without them falling apart and bones sliding all over the place.

            "Our pals at Rio Vista Olives sent us the incredible oil that we cook with in this post. Like everything that we recommend on our blog, we use and love their products, and hope that you will too!",
            "My Ma used to whip up a great beef steak ragu every now and then, nice and simple, with tomatoes and olives. We’d often lift the steak out at the end and eat it with a salad, stirring the sauce through our pasta. I’d forgotten about this little gem of a dish for years, but it recently came to me out of the blue, and so naturally we decided to dream up a Pasta et Al version. The key to it all is that rich olive flavour, and so we thought that we’d stick the olives straight into our pasta dough, and cut it into some fine looking pappardelle. We served it up this week with a short-rib ragu, to tie it back to the meaty, tomatoey goodness that inspired us. So make sure that you jump on over and check out that recipe too!",
            "Unlike our egg yolk version, this recipe uses a relatively high ratio of semolina, and less yolks, making for a more robust pasta to pair with a meaty sauce. It also makes for a more intense kneading session than usual, so prepare yourself!",
            "Note that while you could use any dark or black olive for this dough, we’ve gone for wild South Australian olives, for the more intense flavour that these firm little roadside things bring. Wild olives spread from cultivated plants first brought in by Italian and Greek communities during the 1800s. Since then, while their farm-grown cousins lived plump and comfy lives, they’ve become a hardy pest and threat to native flora and fauna. They’re nonetheless (or perhaps as a result) delicious.",
            "So start off with that good old flour well. If you’ve gone with unpitted olives, which is our preference, give them a whack with the side of a knife to loosen them up, and then remove the flesh. Grind that down to a paste in a mortar and pestle or food processor, and then add it to the centre of the well, along with the remaining dough ingredients. Gradually bring it together into a loose ball, using a fork or just your hand, and then get ready to knead. Alternatively, you can pit the olives and then drop all ingredients into a food processor, pulsing until the olive colour is evenly distributed, and the dough begins to hold together. Whichever method you choose, knead by hand for 10 minutes, pushing down and away from yourself, folding the dough over as you go. Then seal it up in cling wrap to rest for 30 minutes, away from direct sunlight and heat.",
            "Now it’s time to roll! If you’re using a pasta machine, begin by rolling the dough through on the thickest setting a few times, folding over itself in between passes. It may help to initially flatten it out with a rolling pin before feeding it in. Then gradually step it through to a medium-thin setting. We like our pasta chewy, so for us this was a 6, on a 9-setting machine. If you’re not using a machine, give it a few minutes of extra kneading, before rolling it out with a long pin, to your desired thickness (typically, pappardelle is around 2mm thick).",
            "Next, cut the sheets into lengths of approximately 30-40cm, or however long you’d like your pasta to be, and dust lightly with semolina. Use a pasta cutter or sharp knife to form the individual strips of pappardelle. We like super wide pasta, around 4cm, but if you’d prefer to keep it more traditional, cut it closer to 2-3cm.",
            "Finally, to store, either leave your pappardelle stretched out on lightly floured baking paper lined trays or, if it’s adequately floured, you can stack or roll them up to save a bit of space. Keep them uncovered (for a bit of extra bite) in the refrigerator for up to one week.",

Bring together into a rough ball using a fork, or your hand. Alternatively, pit the olives and then blitz all ingredients together in a food processor until the dough begins to hold together.",
                    "Knead the dough vigorously for 10 minutes, pushing down and away from yourself, and folding the dough over itself as you work. Seal in cling wrap or an airtight container, and rest for 30 minutes, away from direct sunlight and heat.",
                    "If using a pasta machine, flatten the dough out a little by hand and then roll it through on the thickest setting a few times, folding it over itself in between passes. Step it through to a medium-thick setting (6, on a 9-setting machine). If not using a machine, knead it gently by hand for a few minutes, and then roll it out in a large sheet to your desired final thickness. Pappardelle is generally around 2mm thick.",
                    "Cut your dough into lengths of approximately 30cm, dust lightly with semolina, and then use a pasta cutter or sharp knife to form the pappardelle, with a width of 3-4cm.",
                    "Transfer to lightly floured, baking paper lined trays, and refrigerate uncovered for up to one week (the resulting dehydration will give the pasta extra bite).",

If you’re after the perfect sauce to pair our wild olive pappardelle with, check out our  short-rib ragu ! Just save some cooking water when draining your pasta, in case your pappardelle and sauce need a little help emulsifying."

            "Our pals at Rio Vista Olives sent us the incredible oil that we cook with in this post. Like everything that we recommend on our blog, we use and love their products, and hope that you will too!",
            "The Italian-Australian experience, and all that it brings with it, is actually the only ‘Italian’ that I’ve ever known. My brother and I grew up with an Italian mum (first-generation Australian) and an English-Australian dad, spending most of our early years in the care of a thoroughly Calabrian Nonna who arrived in that rich 50s boom. To this day, the only Italian that sounds right to me is her comfortable, lazy southern drawl, and the only Italian-English accent that makes sense comes from that same familiar dialect. Likewise, the food, customs, and characters that I grew up knowing first as just family, and then later as ‘Italian’ are actually part of this unique transplanted blend of cultures. And I know that we’re not alone!",
            "So for this week’s pasta we wanted to create a dish that really allowed Italian to meet Australian. Those true native flavours and even shapes that are so well known to our First Peoples, but that we don’t see too much of in recipes.  I think that many Australians feel an affinity with our natural world, but the original custodians of this land have a relationship that spans tens of thousands of years, from long before outsiders first took it from them and disingenuously invited my ancestors in two centuries later. I want little Al to grow up with his own love and appreciation for what we have today, but with this understanding of what brought us here. And of course, we’re a family that passes on ideas and history through food, so we’re starting here with pasta!",
            "Little Al and I carved our own cavarola boards for this dish, featuring some of the amazing shapes that we find in native Australian fauna, and that I remember vividly from my very earliest years. Wattle, that used to grow outside the front door where I grew up in the hills of Perth; parrotbush, that my brother and I used to play in, carefully manoeuvring around the prickles; grevillea, that’d I’d pick for the people I cared about; and seagrass, that I remember diving down amongst on holidays and weekends all along the coast.",
            "We have two incredible dough ingredients to complement our embossed pasta, familiar and exciting at the same time: wattleseed, and peppermint gum. Wattleseed is earthy, a bit like coffee and chocolate, with peppermint gum a light breath of eucalyptus. In dried form, they keep well, and are perfect for mixing into dough.",
            "We’ve also been growing a few edible natives in the garden, so we thought that we’d go for a true Italian-Australian accompanying sauce, in a little nod to those years spent running down the back to collect basil for Nonna’s mortar and pestle. A Genovese-style pesto, but flavoured with punchy native Australian sea celery, lightly salty seablite, hot mountain pepper leaves, and a fresh hint of native mint. Incredible flavours (but go easy on that mountain pepper)!",
            "Now for all of the things that we have growing in our small garden (from herbs and mustard greens used in our pansotti, to edible flowers that you might have seen in our hankies) we always seem to be out of the things that we need most. Like basil. On pesto day. Luckily we’re up for any excuse to go to the markets, and our trusty Ziggy’s Fresh had our backs. As well as being able to rely on them for the various fruit and veg staples that we’ve invariably forgotten about until we get there, there’s nothing better than being able to buy potted herbs at the local green grocer.",
            "Aside from the fact that they’re basically the same price, they keep better, go further, and make a good outdoor project for little people. Little Al is in charge of our garden, so he chose us some plants, ran around underfoot yelling for a few minutes, and then we collected our other pesto ingredients and headed home.",
            "So here it is, our wattleseed and peppermint gum malloreddus with sea celery and macadamia pesto.",
            "First up, proud of them though we are, the boards that we designed and made down in the garage are not essential to the success of this dish. You can use a good old gnocchi board or even the back of a grater or fork as a decent alternative.",
            "The doughs themselves are beautifully simple. Just durum semolina flour with water, a little olive oil, and a pinch of salt. And of course those dried herbs! Remember 10 minutes kneading, before 30 minutes resting, sealed up and away from heat and sunlight.",
            "Then to make the malloreddus, simply roll the dough into long, very thin sausages, cut it into small pea-sized pieces, and use your thumb or a scraper to roll it across your texturing surface. If you have the time, you can roll each piece into a ball to give the finished pasta more tapered edges. Note that we played around a bit with sizes, so while many of these photos show larger pieces of pasta (with more discernible detail), we highly recommend the littler ones that you can see in the plated dish.",
            "You’ll quickly get the hang of that down and away from you pressure, and any pieces that you mess up can easily be squished back up and rerolled!",
            "If you’re storing these in the fridge (up to one week), remember to keep them uncovered for a little extra chewiness.",
            "Now making pesto is as simple as smacking everything around in a mortar and pestle until you’re happy with the consistency. Remember that it’s all about fresh ingredients and high quality olive oil!",
            "Drop the malloreddus into boiling water and cook until no white dough is visible when you cut across them, but no longer! If you’ve made them small, then they should only need 4-5 minutes, but if you’ve gone for grape-sized pieces it could take up to 20. Then toss through the pesto, and serve with a crack of mountain pepper berries and freshly fried native mint.",
            "This is a delightfully simple recipe, extraordinarily tasty, and one that’s perfect for tiny and numerous hands to get involved with. So have fun, and eat well. Buon appetito!",

My long-suffering better half, little Al’s lovely Ma, is the genius cake-extraordinaire behind Forty-Two Cakes. So as a little tribute to her, we’ve taken cake flavours and turned them into pasta! This week we’re making lemon and poppy seed scarpinocc, filled with ricotta and lemon zest, and served with citrus-infused olive oil and freeze-dried sour cherries.",
            "Whether you’re celebrating today as Valentine’s Day, or just as a regular Sunday pasta day, make that person you love a plate of pasta! There are few more heartfelt ways to remind someone of what they mean to you than a lovingly-crafted bowl of carbs.",
            "These little things are named for the clogs that they’re fashioned after, with ‘scarpinocc’ coming from ‘scarpa’ for ‘shoe’. Though they’re traditionally loaded with talleggio, we’ve opted for a filling of ricotta and lemon zest to keep things nice and light. Perfect to serve with a subtly-flavoured, homemade citrus-infused olive oil.",
            "Start off with that dough, giving it a good 10 minutes of kneading before resting it for 30.",
            "While you wait, warm the olive oil with the zest in it over very low heat for 10-15 minutes.  You should be able to smell those delicious citrus oils coming out. Allow it to cool, and then remove and retain the zest for plating. If you’re not using it immediately, you can store it for up to a week in the fridge (leave the zest in for extra flavour).",
            "You should also have time to prepare the filling. Simply mix everything together and stick it in a piping bag. Try to avoid using a food processor to combine ingredients, as it can leave the filling overly runny. If this happens though, just add some breadcrumbs to help it firm up.",
            "To form the scarpinocc, roll your dough out to a medium-thin thickness (for us, on a 9-setting machine, this is a setting of 6), and then stamp circles out with a cookie cutter. These were made with a 8cm diameter circle. Squeeze a walnut-sized dollop of filling into the centre of each dough circle, and then fold in half, pressing to seal. If your dough is feeling a little dry, give it a light spritz of water on the inside before sealing. Try to seal close to the filling, to avoid air pockets that may cause the pasta to burst when boiled.",
            "Next, fold the filled centre over so that the pasta rolls up, leaving the newly sealed edge underneath and slightly off-centre. Pinch the ends flat, vertically. Most importantly, give it a gentle poke on the top centre, to form a little dimple and keep it true to its name.",

            "This week’s dish is short and sweet, figuratively. Otherwise it’s long and savoury. Every now and then we get asked about cocoa pasta, so this week we’re sharing our go-to recipe for cocoa fettuccine, served with a mascarpone and walnut sauce, and topped with toasted buckwheat. We like to pair the pure, bitter cocoa with other savoury flavours, but you could quite easily serve it with something sweeter if that’s your thing.",
            "And yes, we hope that you’re in the mood for a spot of ugly food. Because for all of its merits, from polyphenols in the cocoa to the short cooking time of the sauce, brown pasta in a creamy sauce is a bit of a visual contrast to last week’s picturesque asparagus and mascarpone cappellacci.",
            "We’ve talked at length before about the gluten properties of flour, and the makeup of pasta doughs, so I won’t get into it again now, but I will say that the amount of cocoa we use in this recipe significantly lowers the integrity of the dough as the pasta’s made. Once cooked, it holds together well, and can even be folded to form filled pasta, but you may notice similarities with our gluten-free dough as you’re rolling it out. Just persevere, give it plenty of kneading and refolding as you pass it through the machine, and don’t worry if those pasta sheet edges are a little ragged.",
            "So mix up your dough ingredients as you would for any other pasta, and make sure that you give it a full ten minutes of kneading before resting it for half an hour. If you’re using a pasta machine, we always recommend rolling the dough through the thickest setting a few times, folding over itself in between passes. This helps strengthen those gluten bonds a little more, like an extension of the kneading time, and is particularly important for doughs like this (where 20% of the dry component contains no gluten). Then incrementally step it through to a medium-thick setting; for us, on a 9-setting machine, this is 5.",
            "Slice it with a fettuccine attachment, or a good old knife. Though there’s an enduring and validly pedantic argument over the differences between fettuccine and tagliatelle, it’s mostly about whether you hand-cut it or not. So if you use a knife, call it tagliatelle.",
            "You can lightly toss your fresh pasta in flour and then transfer to baking paper lined trays, or hang it up on a pasta rack until it begins to stiffen, before carefully laying it out on trays. Just make sure that you don’t leave it dangling for too long, as it is quite brittle before it’s cooked. Store your pasta uncovered in the refrigerator for up to one week and it will dehydrate nicely, gaining a firm bite.",
            "Cocoa pasta is really well suited to earthy flavours like mushrooms or ox-tail, but if you’re after something quicker, you can’t go wrong with cheese. In fact, our sauce takes little more time than you need to melt the mascarpone. Just grind your walnuts to a paste and throw them in a pan with the butter and cheese, and stir until it’s melted. Add your cooked al dente fettuccine into the pan, toss it through (using a little retained pasta water if it’s looking too dry or not emulsifying properly), and serve it up. We also toasted some buckwheat and a few extra walnuts to plate with, and can highly recommend the addition of a little gorgonzola if you’re in the mood.",

            "Our pals at Rio Vista Olives sent us the incredible oil that we cook with in this post. Like everything that we recommend on our blog, we use and love their products, and hope that you will too!",
            "One of little Al’s favourite things is our weekend trip to the markets. We’ve got a routine now, that starts with a snack and a coffee – decaf macchiato for him, double espresso for me, followed by the butcher, deli, and wholefood shop, before finishing with the fruit and veggies at our favourite little grocer, Ziggy’s Fresh. Little Al talks about it all week and tells anyone who’ll listen.",
            "If you remember way back, we actually once dedicated another special cappellacci recipe to the friendly folks at Ziggy’s. It had been literally decades since I even knew the people who sold me my food, so the least that we could do was invent a dish for our new friends. Especially after they sourced us a same-week box of nettles, at the very end of the season, after a random Instagram message from me…",
            "Anyway, since then, Little Al’s grown to the mighty age of two, and has found a best pal in one particular member of the Ziggy’s crew, Claire. Before we can even settle down for our coffee, he has to check that she’s in, usually at the counter behind the strawberries. Every week she finds the time to chat with him, give him a flower, or play a quick game of hide and seek around the store, and I really can’t say how grateful we are for that. Not only for the way that this supports a hopefully life-long healthy relationship with food, but more importantly the simple but profound impact that a friendship like this, between an adult and a child, can have on a little person.",
            "This week’s recipe uses the freshest and finest ingredients hand-picked from Ziggy’s by little Al; everything from asparagus and red cabbage, to micro-herbs and cheese. We do like a good trip to the deli for our cheese, but this is easier said than done when your tiny co-shopper decides that it’s time for running laps. After helping to whip him into this frenzy with hide and seek, Ziggy’s benevolently provided a cheese cabinet, so we quickly added mascarpone and crumbled feta to our basket before running a few more circuits and heading home.",
            "So here it is then, dedicated to Claire, and all of those fine people out there who take the time for the little gestures that make such big impacts. Asparagus and mascarpone cappellacci, made with a spinach-spiralled dough, and served in a red cabbage broth with feta, pistachios, and shiso micro-greens. It’s a big call, and maybe we’re a little biased, but we think you’ll love it.",
            "This dish came together in my head as I brushed my teeth the night before I made it, so everyone was a little surprised when it turned out to be such a winner. Perhaps one of the most delicious things that we’ve dreamed up so far for this blog. For the sake of impartiality (of a kind), Forty-Two Cakes confirms that it was indeed a winner. We wanted something that was colourful, light, and had a balance of subtle flavours, and we think that this is it. With a bright purple broth, it was also hard to resist doing something a bit fun with the pasta. So of course we made spirals!",
            "Despite initial appearances, the whole thing’s pretty straightforward. It might resemble some of the more time-consuming stuff that we’ve made in the past, but we promise that you can pull this off effortlessly in little more than an hour. That said, If the spirals seem just too daunting, either mix all of the dough ingredients together to make one big old lump of pale green dough, or check out any of our previous spinach-based doughs (like our spinach ravioli), or even plain doughs (like we used for our farfalle), for perfectly respectable substitutions.",
            "So, start off with that dough, ideally working one at a time. Mix the flours together and then divide into two even amounts. Half of the egg and oil into each, then spinach into one and water into the other. Knead for 10 minutes, then rest for 30.",
            "To prepare the broth, simply sauté the red cabbage, onion, garlic, and peppercorns until soft, then add in the rest of the broth ingredients and simmer for around 20 minutes. Strain the liquid out but don’t throw away that cabbage! For a great side dish, we like to mix it with some blanched greens and dress it all with olive oil, lemon juice, a little minced garlic, and maybe a bit of crumbly cheese.",
            "For the filling, blanch the asparagus, and then blend it into the mascarpone and breadcrumbs, before sticking it into a piping bag. If it’s your kind of thing (it’s ours), hang onto the tips for plating.",
            "Now the pasta! Roll each piece of dough through your pasta machine to a medium-thin thickness. We’ve got a 9-thickness machine, so for us that’s a setting of 5. To laminate, lay one out flat, give it a spritz of water, and then smooth the second piece down on top. Pass it through the machine up to a thick setting of 3, spritz the top of it again, and then roll it into a tight log, short end to short end.",
            "Use a sharp knife to cut your pasta log into thin discs (this recipe should allow around 28), and then roll each of those through the machine to a setting of 5. Make sure that you keep any pasta you’re not working on covered up, to prevent it drying out. If you find that it is drying, use a light spritz of water to soften it up.",
            "Finally, squeeze a grape-sized lump of filling into the centre of each piece, fold it in half pressing down around the filling to seal, and then cut a semi-circle with the dough fold along the straight edge. A round cookie cutter is just the ticket! Turn it into cappellacci by drawing the corners around the filling, and pinching gently slightly behind where the points meet.",
            "Cook them al dente (of course), and serve them up in that broth, topped with the asparagus tips, crumbled feta, zucchini ribbons, pistachios, and shiso.",

            "Pretty much the only thing better than a plate of stuffed and fried gnocchi, is a plate of bright purple stuffed and fried gnocchi. This week we’ve made a light dough out of roasted purple potatoes and filled it with creamy eggplant. Finished in a sage-infused butter and tossed in olive oil, they have a comfortingly subtle flavour, but with a bold hit of colour.",
            "Gnocchi were a bit of a treat when I was a kid, not because they’re particularly difficult to make, but just because we rarely thought to make them. I still remember watching my Nonna’s wrinkled hands angling the gnocchi board, or more commonly the back of a fork, as she rolled their ridges. For at least my younger years, there was an air of mystique to creating such a perfect shape so casually on a random piece of cutlery. For this recipe though, there’s nothing too fiddly: we’re simply wrapping a disc of dough around some filling, before gently flattening it back out (so that we have more surface area to fry). Grab your favourite coloured potato, ideally a good one for mashing, and let’s get cooking.",
            "This is a nice straightforward recipe, but it takes a little time to get everything roasted before you can start making pasta. Of course you can also steam or boil your potatoes, but note that sometimes boiling will leave them a bit waterlogged and require the addition of more flour. If your hands are up to it, peel the potatoes while they’re still warm, as the skins will come off easier.",
            "Once you’ve riced the potatoes and mixed up your dough, give it a short knead of a couple of minutes. You want it to develop a good glutinous elasticity without becoming too firm – this will help when it comes to stretching and wrapping the dough around the filling. While it’s resting, scoop out the eggplant and blend up your filling, then load it into a piping bag.",
            "To form the filled gnocchi, roll the dough into long thick sausages, and then chop them into roughly walnut-sized pieces. Alternatively just tear it into chunks.",
            "Form each piece into a ball, rolling between your hands, and then flatten them into circles. Pipe a grape-sized dollop of filling into each, and then bring the edges up and around to meet in the centre. Give it a pinch to seal, and then gently re-flatten into plump discs. Store these on a lightly-floured surface until you’re ready to cook them, to prevent sticking.",
            "Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil, and heat the oil in a frypan. Drop the gnocchi into the pot and remove with a slotted spoon once they float. Blot dry. Quickly fry up the sage and then the gnocchi, flipping and cooking until they begin to brown. Plate up, drizzle with a little extra oil, and enjoy!",

            "Our pals at Rio Vista Olives sent us the incredible oil that we cook with in this post. Like everything that we recommend on our blog, we use and love their products, and hope that you will too!",
            "We had to do it. We had to make a festive season pasta. This week’s two-tone fusilli combines tomato and spinach doughs into hand-rolled twisty goodness. Served in a light nduja-spiced sauce, with crispy basil and sage leaves and cherry bocconcini, what better way to celebrate the closing out of the year? Pignolata, that’s how! To finish our dish we’ve prepared these usually sweet Christmas treats as savoury gold-coated baubles, and used them to dress our tinsel-like pasta. Because ‘tis the season.",
            "Pignolata are one of my favourite festive treats from when I was a kid. One of the very best things about Christmas was sitting at Nonna’s long table with one hand in the zippoli, and the other in the pignolata.",
            "We’ve taken two old classics, our spinach dough and the tomato dough that you might have seen here and there on our Instagram, and laminated them together (it’s the same process as our lemon and squid-ink two-tone linguine). So to begin, just mix up and knead each of the doughs for 10 minutes, and then let them rest for 30. Remember that you can always refrigerate dough at this stage, for up to a few days, just be sure that it’s returned to room temperature before you start rolling it out.",
            "Once you’ve rolled it out into thin sheets, layer one of each type together, giving the bottom sheet a quick water spritz before carefully laying the top sheet down. Smooth out any air bubbles with your hand as you go. Either give it a quick roll with a rolling pin, or open the machine up a couple of stops and roll it back through, ending on a setting one stop thicker than you initially rolled them to.",
            "Cut into lengths of approximately 15cm, with a width of around 1cm, and then wrap each piece around a thin dowel or thick skewer. If you have enough dowel for it, keep the pasta twisted around them for a while before removing; this will help them hold their shape and make them easier to handle.",
            "Transfer to lightly-floured baking paper lined oven trays, and allow to dry out in the fridge for up to one week.",
            "For those pignolata, it’s time to make a third dough! Mix together the flour, zest, salt, baking powder, and butter to form a loose, crumbly meal. Note that we’re leaving out the sweetness, but if you want to cook these with their original dessert intention in mind, simply add some sugar with a dash of vanilla essence (and a hit of anisette if you’re that way inclined). Next, gradually pour in the egg as you stir, and bring it together into a ball. Seal it up in cling wrap, and give it 30 minutes in the fridge.",
            "Roll the pignolata dough out into long thin sausages, just as you would for pasta like our casarecce or gemelli. Chop these into small chickpea-sized pieces, and then roll them into balls between your hands.",
            "Dredge lightly in flour and then fry them up. Once they’re cool, paint them gold and be jolly. Or, to serve them as sweets, heat some honey and a good pinch of sugar in a pan, then toss in the pignolata.",
            "Before you get into the sauce, you’re going to need tomatoes. Of course, you can always use bottled passata, which is what we usually do, but in the spirit of the old sitting around in the garage with hankies on our heads Looking for Alibrandi days, we decided to go with fresh tomatoes this week. Personally (although not authentic), I didn’t think it was necessary to sieve or mill out the skins this time around, but we did remove the seeds and the juice before blending them up. In honour of Nonna, the head hankies came out.",
            "Now fry up the leaves. It should only take a few seconds on medium-high heat. Remove and drain, then toss in the nduja – the single most delicious ingredient in the world – and stir for a few minutes, using the spoon to break it up. Then add in the tomatoes and a pinch each of salt and sugar. Drop the heat to low-medium and cook for 10-15 minutes, until it thickens and begins to lose its raw flavour.",
            "Cook and drain the fusilli, retaining a bit of water in case you need it to aid emulsification, and then toss the pasta through the sauce in the frypan. Serve with the fried leaves, golden pignolata, and cherry bocconcini.",

            "This week we’re throwing back to the 80s! This spinach and ricotta rotolo was something that my Mum used to cook up for special occasions, back when béchamel was big. Or so I’m told. I was more a concept than a thing at the time, and I’m not sure that béchamel ever actually went out of fashion anyway, so take that as you will.",
            "This is a more involved, multi-process recipe than those we normally serve up, but if you’ve got the time and are after a bit of a treat, this is one for you.",
            "This rotolo’s got it all. You fill it, roll it, wrap it, boil it; slice it, sauce it, bake it, eat it. At its heart though is the old familiar sheet of pasta with filling, and a creamy tomato sauce.",
            "Once you’ve kneaded your dough and it’s happily resting, cook up that filling. Much like our anolini, simply roll the dough out into two thin sheets, and then spread the filling to evenly cover each. While you’re doing that, bring a big pot of water to the boil (this will be what you boil the wrapped rotolo in).",
            "Starting at one narrow edge, roll each filled sheet up tightly, then place them in clean, non-fibrous, tea towels. Wrap them up like giant lollies, and tie closed as you would a big chunk of meat. Drop them in and boil them up!",
            "Once cooked, remove and allow to cool. While you wait, heat the oven, and prepare the light tomato sauce and the béchamel. Remember to go slow with the béchamel, stirring constantly to avoid clumps. If you do clump it up though, don’t stress, you can always hit it with a stick blender after mixing it into the tomato sauce.",
            "With the final creamy combined sauce prepared, slice the rotolo and layer it up in a baking dish. Standing the slices up on a slight angle will help cover them in sauce and give each a little bit of crispy browning when cooked. Then just stick it in the oven and hang around impatiently until the sauce starts to crack and brown.",
            "This is a rich old dish, with a fair bit of work required, so while it might not be an every week kind of thing it’ll certainly live up to expectations for something special.",

            "Our pals at Rio Vista Olives sent us the incredible oil that we cook with in this post. Like everything that we recommend on our blog, we use and love their products, and hope that you will too!",
            "Sometimes we cook up the classics, other times we think: what would you get if you made sea anemones out of pasta, plated them into a rockpool, and made that rockpool out of margaritas? This week’s pasta is lime and tequila prawn sacchettoni, made with blue spirulina dough, and served in citrus salt enclosed pools of juniper-olive oil, dehydrated blood orange and lime, pippies, and fresh seaweed.",
            "To be honest, this little dish actually began with the idea of blue spirulina pasta. We’d made dough with chlorella before, but wanted to try out the algae thing in blue. It seemed only natural to make it a seafood dish, and the thought of salt and citrus lead me to the margarita, which in turn lead me to tequila prawns. As an avid diver and underwater macrophotography enthusiast, I thought it was time to reimagine our sacchettoni (that you might remember from our previous charcoal recipe) as anemones, and so suddenly we were building a margarita rockpool.",
            "There are a few bits and pieces to get together for this recipe, but like our smoky nettle cappellacci it’ll all be worth it when it comes time to construct your little pasta world!",
            "A bit like our red dragonfruit tortelli, some of that incredible blue will be lost when the pasta’s cooked (interestingly I haven’t found this to happen with chlorella), but you’ll still be left with a gorgeous blue-slate colour that’s a little less incongruous in a rockpool anyway. We only ever use actual foods to give colour to our pasta, but of course if you’d like that bright blue colour to stay around after cooking, just add a little bottled colour into your dough hydration.",
            "The dough itself is pretty straightforward, and you can whip it up in the usual well, kneading it as a ball for 10 minutes, before resting for 30.",
            "The prawns are simple to prepare too – just let them sit in that marinade for a bit, before giving them a couple of minutes in a high heat pan. Then blitz to a paste and roll into large grape-sized balls.",
            "Once your dough’s ready, roll it out to a medium-thin thickness and cut it into rough squares, dropping a ball of filling into the centre and bundling it up into sacchettoni.",
            "You’ll need a little more time to make those citrus chips, so you might want to prepare them in advance (they last really well). Of course, if you have an actual dehydrator, just chuck them in there and let it do its thing. Otherwise stick your oven on low and give them a few hours, turning occasionally. Once they feel and look dry (eg. firm and no shiny bits left on the flesh), they’re probably ready. Note that they’ll become crisper as they cool.",
            "Then just boil up those pippies, lifting them out with a slotted spoon when they’re done, and retaining that water to cook the pasta in. Remember to discard any pippies that don’t open. And you’re ready to plate up!",
            "We grabbed a small bowl, dipped the rim in molasses, and then stamped circles to sprinkle with our citrus salt. Shake any excess off, and then start building your rockpools. Fill the margarita rims with olive oil right before serving to prevent the salt from dissolving.",
            "It’s all a bit of delicious fun, so follow along closely, or take our ideas and do your own thing with them. Either way, buon appetito!",

Mix up your flours and salt, form it into a well with the eggs and oil in the centre, and then use a fork to bring it together into a raggedy delicious mess. Knead for 10, rest for 30. Make sure that you keep it wrapped while it rests, and out of any direct sunlight or heat.

            "Happy International Pasta Day! The first, in fact, since Pasta et Al began. This week we’ve mixed a little nostalgia into our pasta: figs, anisette, and the lolly bowl!",
            "One of the most enduring memories that I have of my Nonna’s house is actually my Nonno’s liqueur cabinet, filled with mysterious and intricate glassware, and the intoxicating smell of anisette. Always competing for my fickle loyalty was my great aunty, who would keep a box of those rectangular Italian lollies at the ready to bribe us with. And my mum loves figs! So little Al and I are very excited to present our latest creation, fig and anisette caramelle.",
            "With figs finally appearing at the markets, and Rio Vista Olives having just sent us a bottle of their Merchant Spice Agrumato, we already knew that it was time to make this happen. And then, serendipitously, I happened to try The Canberra Distillery’s Canberra Fog. Aside from being a delicious little anisette in its own right, the story behind it took me back to my childhood. Though where they hark back to the copper stills of migrant Snowy Mountains hydro-power scheme workers, my memories are of the somewhat illegal stills operated by my migrant orchardist uncles, and that incredible scent of grappa floating through the air of the Perth hills every Sunday morning.",
            "This recipe sounds a bit tricky, but we promise you that it’s quick, easy, and fun! Start off by mixing up the rich egg yolk dough. In place of water we’ve used anisette. It’s only a small amount, but this pasta is all about building subtle, interesting flavour, and there’ll be a little more in the filling. As always, give that 10 minutes of kneading, and then rest it for half an hour.",
            "Next, caramelise the open sides of the figs in the spiced oil (or regular extra virgin olive oil if you don’t have any) with the rosemary. Then just blend the figs with the anisette and stick it in a piping bag! Refrigerate to help it firm up.",
            "Now for the fun bit. Once you’ve rolled out the dough to a medium-thin thickness (6 on the machine), cut it into small squares of around 6cm. Pipe a small line of the fig paste along one edge, stopping around 2cm short of each side. Then roll them up over the filling. To form, carefully pinch the ends together, drawing the dough around the filling to create a rectangular centre. Done!",
            "Cook your pasta until al dente at its thickest, then drain and toss in oil before serving. Finish it off with a crumble of gorgonzola dolce and freeze-dried raspberry, then send a photo straight to Ma.",
            "We always love to see people making our recipes, so if you give it a go, send us a pic! Remember that you can always change out ingredients, swap doughs, and of course make your very own pasta shapes, particularly with a recipe like this. Just have fun doing it!",

            "If there’s one pasta dish that everyone knows to mention with a wink and a nod, it’s puttanesca. This is a dish born from necessity and hard times; so keep your pantry stocked with tins and jars of long-life ingredients, and then when fresh produce is hard to find, or you can’t quite summon the will to leave the house for it, smugly whip yourself up a plate of puttanesca.",
            "I’m not going to lie, puttanesca was first introduced to me as a flavour of tinned tuna. And yes, I may be guilty of stirring the odd one of those tins through a plate of pasta and calling it dinner. But hey, that’s just embracing the intent of the dish. This week we’ve served our puttanesca with a simple cracked pepper fettuccine.",
            "This week’s fettuccine uses the old familiar 100g of flour to 1 egg recipe. You might remember variations of it from our farfalle, fagottini, tortelli, sacchettoni, or pretty much any general pasta dough recipe. This week we used 20% semolina, with the rest made up of 00 flour.",
            "Just add a pinch of salt, and keep cracking that pepper in to taste. If you stir the dry ingredients around as you add the pepper, you’ll get a pretty good feel for the eventual distribution through the dough. It should be similar to those delicious cracked pepper water cracker things.",
            "Mix everything together in a well until it forms a ball, knead it for 10 minutes, then let it rest for another 30. We rolled ours through to a medium thickness of 6 on the pasta machine, before cutting it.",
            "Transfer to baking paper lined trays, and refrigerate covered for up to a week (for that chewy bite).",
            "In keeping with the spirit of the dish (pantry items, not occupational) we rounded up the best half-finished jars of stuff in the fridge, and grabbed a tin of tomatoes.",
            "Just fry up those anchovies, garlic cloves, capers, and chilli, then toss in your tinned tomatoes and olives. Cook it until you’re happy with the flavour and thickness, this shouldn’t take more than 15 minutes, then add your freshly made and cooked al dente fettuccine directly into the pan.",
            "This is a guilty pleasure kind of dish for us, because it doesn’t use any fresh ingredients, and the total cooking time is less time than it takes to even rest the pasta dough. But it’s like that by nature, and more delicious for it!",

That was our original family dish, but we also use to make the occasional meat or pumpkin filled variety, which is what’s inspired this week’s pasta. A simple but satisfying mix of earthy dough, creamy filling, and crispy little bits of meat!",
            "To try out a new flavour and texture for our dough, we mixed in a good amount of rye meal, and more olive oil than we’d normally use. Then we filled our ravioli with a smooth blend of baked pumpkin and garlic, and served them tossed through some crispy lamb mince and wilted greens. And you know, we reckon that it turned out pretty well.",
            "When it comes to ravioli, the more hands the merrier. Particularly little earnest hands. So grab the gang and flour the kitchen table.",
            "It all begins and ends with the dough. We wanted an earthier taste, so made this week’s dough with one quarter rye meal. Mixing it with doppio zero and bread flour left it workable despite the coarser rye, and the olive oil helped to keep it soft. Not to mention moisturising my dry, cracked hands.",
            "Give it the usual 10 minutes of kneading and 30 of resting, and it’ll serve you well.",
            "For the filling, simply roast the pumpkin and garlic, then discard the pumpkin skin and squeeze out the gooey garlic. Mash it all together with nutmeg, sage, and salt, then stick it in a piping bag.",
            "You can always use different trays or hand stamps to form your ravioli, but I’ve used these open ravioli trays my whole life, and swear by them. Just give them a good dusting of flour before you lay out the bottom sheets, press lightly to mark out the tray before you start piping, and then roll the enclosed pasta until the cutting edge shows clearly through the dough.",
            "Flip the tray over, give it a bash, and take a few photos of the perfect pasta that falls out.",

            "Little Al and I were playing around with cookie cutters, making a lot of mess and noise, when we came up with this week’s shape. It’s kind of close to funghini pasta, so that’s what we’re calling it. We wanted to pair it with a rich, spicy arrabbiata sauce, and this shape allowed us to work in some two-tone laminated goodness of spinach and paprika doughs: one flavour to contrast with the sugo and one to complement. These fun guys were the result. And for something a little different, we separately fried the salami and basil for the sauce, serving it crumbled and stirred through. Nothing too tricky or too fancy, but a little bit interesting and particularly delicious!",
            "If you remember our two-tone lemon zest and squid ink pasta, then this is basically the same process. We recommend that you initially blitz each dough’s ingredients together in a food processor to properly combine everything (and achieve a smooth, uniform colour), before giving it the usual 10 minutes of kneading and 30 of resting. You can of course mix it up by hand in an old flour well, but it might take you longer and the colour may not be as even in the final dough.",
            "Then step it through your pasta machine, before laying one pasta on top of the other and passing them back through to laminate together.",
            "To form the funghini, simply use a round cookie cutter to stamp out circles of pasta, before pinching two opposite edges together, and bringing the subsequently formed inner folds together to meet.",
            "The sauce is even easier. Just fry the basil leaves until bright green and the sopressa until crispy. Then remove them from the pan, drain, and use the remaining oil to fry up the garlic, adding the chilli flakes shortly before the passata, sugar, and salt. Give it 10-15 minutes on the stove, and you’re good to go.",
            "Cook the pasta in lightly salted water, until al dente, and then drain (retaining half a cup of cooking water in case the sauce needs it). Toss the pasta directly into the frypan with the arrabbiata, and stir through crumbled basil leaves and sopressa before serving. That’s it!",

We use and love all of the bits and pieces that we recommend on our blog, and hope that you will too!",
            "One of my favourite childhood dishes, that my Mum still makes when I visit, was peperonata. Ours was simply capsicums and potatoes, roasted with breadcrumbs and a good hit of olive oil: a magic combination. I’d always thought that it would be fun to capture these flavours in pasta, but had never quite settled on how to do it. Do you focus on the potato or the capsicum? And then, suddenly, I remembered doppio ravioli. Perché non entrambi? Our fillings this week are a cheesy potato mash and a rich capsicum pesto, wrapped in a silky egg yolk dough, and served with spun balsamic sugar, roasted tomatoes, and olive oil.",
            "You might recall us extolling the virtues of the independent grocer a couple of months back, when we made our smokey nettle cappellacci; well our local Ziggy’s have come through once more. This week they very generously loaded us up with a box of fresh produce and a box of pantry staples to see what we could come up with. Now full disclosure, I was very sceptical. My past experiences of letting someone else select my fruit and veg, cough unnamed supermarket chains cough, have ranged from hilarious and absurd to downright disappointing. It’s like the packers delighted in competing with each other to select the most pathetic offerings of everything I ordered. Think a piece of sweet potato the size of my thumb, a head of broccoli the size of a large floret, or a bag full of half rotted garlic. So little Al and I were delighted to find a solid selection of top-quality produce awaiting us. Once the shock wore off, as we poked through our potential ingredients, I knew that it was time to turn peperonata into pasta.",
            "The concept of doppio ravioli is simple: two fillings harmoniously sealed alongside each other in one piece of pasta. They’re also larger than regular ravioli, so not as fiddly as they sound. Given a carton of fresh eggs, we decided to make a rich, silky egg yolk dough. For this size serving (four people), you’ll need 15 yolks, so be prepared to catch those unused egg whites and store them away for some later culinary adventure.",
            "Start off by tossing your veggies in olive oil, and then sticking them in a 200 degree Celsius oven until they start to brown and char; at the same time, boil the potato. Then both of the fillings are made by simply blending together their respective ingredients once the veggies have cooled. Load them into separate piping bags with medium round tips.",
            "The pasta dough is combined and worked as usual, being kneaded for 10 minutes, rested for 30, and then quartered. Roll each of these pieces through the pasta machine’s widest setting a few times, folding over itself in between passes, before stepping it through to a medium thickness of 6.",
            "These ravioli are large squares made up of two separately sealed rectangles. To form them, alternately pipe strips of filling onto 2 of the 4 pasta sheets, each long dollop about the size of a little finger. If it helps with spacing, mark your rectangles out in advance with the dowel that will later be used to seal the pasta. Each ravioli half should be about two finger widths across, and almost as tall as the sheet. Then lay the other sheets of pasta across the top, and pat down gently with your hand, before sealing firmly into rectangles using the dowel. Use a fluted pasta cutter to separate the rectangles into paired squares, and then transfer to lightly floured baking paper lined trays.",
            "The spun balsamic sugar was actually a little experiment that worked better than expected. We wanted to recreate that flavour that you get from tossing balsamic vinegar into pan-fried veggies, letting it caramelise right before serving. But a little fancier. To make it, simply heat the spun sugar ingredients to 140-150 degrees Celsius, and test that you can stretch out tendrils of the melted mixture between two forks. We laid a heavy wooden spoon on its side with the handle hanging off the edge of the bench (and paper towels underneath), then drizzled the syrup along it so that it stretched down towards the ground. Then just use another wooden spoon, or even your hand, to roll it up into a loose nest.",
            "If you make as much of a mess as we did, you’ll also end up with some fun frozen drips hanging off the spoon that will be perfect for plating.",
            "Once you’ve cooked your pasta, al dente of course, plate it up with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a crack of black pepper. Right before serving, place the sugar nest on top, with 4-5 roast cherry tomatoes inside. And that’s it!",
            "We loved the delicate hit of sweetness from the balsamic and tomatoes alongside our modern twist on peperonata, and we hope that you do too! As always, play around with our recipe, and even swap in your own favourite flavour combinations.",

            "Our pals at Rio Vista Olives sent us the incredible oil that we cook with in this post. Like everything that we recommend on our blog, we use and love their products, and hope that you will too!",
            "We’re regularly asked about gluten-free pasta, and to be honest the only reason that we haven’t blogged about it yet is that it feels a little too simple to put on a recipe card. Which of course is no reason at all. So this week, please accept our apologies for not posting it sooner, and enjoy our recipe for gluten-free reginette. Note that reginette normally has ruffled edges, as opposed to only frilled, but it’s a tricky thing to do when you’re cutting your pasta by hand!",
            "There are many complicated recipes floating around out there to guide you through the alchemy of creating your own gluten-free flour mix, but we’re going to keep it simple. We just swap out our regular flour for store-bought plain GF flour, and throw in some xanthan gum. The key isn’t so much in the ingredients as it is in understanding the role of gluten, and the considerations of using a gum in its place (this includes knowing its limitations). We’ve made GF pasta a number of times now, and though it can be a little frustrating pulling it together, it’s always produced a springy, satisfying meal.",
            "So in simple terms, non-GF pasta ‘works’ because of the proteins collectively known as gluten. Just about every week we highlight and discuss the flour that we’re using in terms of its gluten content, its elasticity, and its strength. When we mix our flours we do consider flavour, but more so we’re after the perfect balance of these structural aspects, as suited to the pasta that we’re intending to make. When we knead, we’re forming and strengthening the bonds that hold it all together, and when we let the dough rest, we’re allowing the gluten to relax a bit so that it can be shaped into pasta. What does that mean for gluten-free pasta-making? Throw it all out the window: it’s time to relearn pasta dough!",
            "If you were to swap in GF flour without adding xanthan gum (or similar), your pasta would just fall apart. That said, even with xanthan gum it can be difficult to achieve some pasta shapes. So we’re going to give you a quick recipe for GF reginette (or mafaldine, depending on who you ask), and you can skip straight through to that if you like, but we’re also going to test out a few other pasta shapes using that same dough. Read on if you’d like to see how it holds up!",
            "A perk of GF pasta is that you only have to knead it for long enough to remove any clumps (as there’s no gluten to activate), and you don’t need to rest it before getting down to business. That small amount of gum goes a long way, and you’ll be surprised at how quickly the dough hardens up once it meets the eggs, so don’t be tempted to overdo it otherwise your pasta will be very hard to work with!",
            "Mix your flour, salt, and xanthan gum together, and form that iconic pasta well. Then drop your eggs into the centre, and bring it all together with a fork or your hand. If you have a food processor, we do recommend that you start it off in there to ensure even distribution of ingredients, but you may need still to squash it together by hand after you’ve pulsed it a few times.",
            "Chop the dough into quarters and roll it through the pasta machine’s thickest setting, before gradually stepping it through to a 5 or 6 (medium thickness). Of course you can always use a rolling pin, flattening it out into sheets of around 1.5-2mm thickness (we tend to keep our GF pasta slightly thicker to offset its brittle nature). Now, here’s the thing: rolling out GF dough take’s some patience. Firstly, it needs to be squashed rather than stretched, so before you feed it into the machine do yourself a favour and flatten it out as best you can with your hands or a rolling pin. Then be prepared for lots of holes and tears. Just keep folding it back over itself to cover the gaps, and rolling back through those wider machine settings until you have a workable sheet that you can incrementally thin. Any ragged edges can be trimmed off in the next step.",
            "Then lay out sheets of around 30cm length on a lightly floured surface and form your reginette with a frilled rolling pastry cutter.",
            "Pasta machines like the Atlas 150 come with fettuccine and tagliolini cutters, so we cut some of this dough with them too, just to show you that it can be done! The tagliolini was quite delicate and required careful handling, but the fettuccine was robust and could be tossed around.",
            "In the past I’ve found that gluten-free pasta is best served same-day. It will keep for a few days in the fridge, but you don’t stand to benefit from the resulting dehydration (in terms of chewiness) like you would for pasta containing gluten.",
            "We cooked it up and served it with our pink peppercorn brown butter and a bit of parsley, but it goes just as well with a light tomato sauce or a pork shoulder ragu, if you feel like treating yourself. Although it’s quite brittle as it’s being made, once cooked it can withstand being stirred through the heartiest of sauces.",
            "Note that we often throw some puréed spinach into our GF dough, as that highly-refined flour taste can sometimes be a bit strong, and the spinach balances it out. If you’re interested in trying it out, you can simply adapt our spinach fettuccine recipe, using the same ratio of xanthan gum to flour as in this recipe.",

You’ll lose a little of the already pale colour as it cooks, but the pasta will retain a deep fruitiness. We served them up with a chunky sauce of crispy sausage meat, fried chunks of bread, and wilted greens, for a satisfying dish loaded with texture and flavour.",

There should be no such thing as ‘cooking wine’, just as there should be no such thing as ‘cooking oil’! It’s even more important when working with simple dishes that you choose the very best quality ingredients.",

            "Pasta handkerchiefs! Growing up, the only hankies we had in the kitchen were either worn on our heads with the corners knotted, or magicked out of nowhere by Nonna, to be spat on and ferociously applied to whatever mess I’d covered myself with. And flowers with pasta? “Why you do that for?”. But here we are, laminating flowers into pasta, and cutting them into fazzoletti.",
            "Anyone who’s eaten a big old square of pasta will know that it’s actually very satisfying. It sates the same desire as pasta that’s stuck together during boiling. It’s about a big, hearty mouthful of carbs. And hey, it’s way less work to cut your pasta into giant squares. If you took one look at the work involved in our farfalle, and thought that this pasta game wasn’t for you, then maybe this is the shape you’ve been waiting for.",
            "Fazzoletti, or mandilli di seta (literally ‘silk handkerchiefs’), are originally from Liguria. So yes, you guessed it, they’re traditionally served with pesto. Whilst we love to get creative with our recipes, and generate the odd bit of controversy amongst the pasta purists, it’s sometimes hard to argue with a classic pairing of pasta and sauce. Grab some fresh basil, some quality cheese, and a gorgeous spot of extra virgin olive oil. Add nuts, garlic, and seasoning, and you’ve got the perfect fresh pairing for your fazzoletti.",
            "You know the drill. Mix those flours together, and form your glorious benchtop pasta well. Add the egg yolks, water, and olive oil into the centre, and then gradually combine with a fork. Once the dough begins to come together, get your hands in there and form it into a ball. Knead vigorously for 10 minutes, before sealing it up in an airtight container, and resting away from heat or direct sunlight for 30 minutes.",
            "Once it’s rested, give it another quick knead, or pass it through the thickest setting on the pasta machine a few times, folding over itself in between passes. Step it through to a relatively thin setting (we used 6), and then cut it into sheets, laying half out on a lightly floured surface. Scatter the edible flowers over those, before covering with the remaining sheets and sealing gently with your hands.",
            "Open the machine back up to a wider setting (for us this was 4), and then carefully pass the paired sheets through to laminate. Step up by one more setting and pass the sheets through again. Cut into squares and refrigerate uncovered on lightly floured, baking paper lined trays.",
            "For the pesto, throw everything into a mortar and pestle or food processor, or hit it with the stick blender. Once you have a thick, smooth paste, you’re good to go.",
            "We served this pasta drizzled with a generous glug of extra virgin olive oil and a few fresh edible flowers, keeping the pesto on the side so that all of our hard flower-laminating work wasn’t hidden. But obviously once you’ve taken your brag photo, stir that pesto through!",

            "This week we wanted to bring you a filled pasta dish that you can knock up in less than an hour; something packed with fresh flavour, and accompanied by a sauce that you can make without a single pot or pan. These simple pansotti, filled with rainbow chard, radicchio, mustard greens, marjoram, and ricotta are what we came up with. They’re served with a delicious walnut sauce that’s made entirely with a stick blender!",
            "We were surprised ourselves at how well these flavours came together, and how pleasantly different the whole dish was compared to our more familiar pasta flavours. It was also so easy to make, and extremely flexible as a recipe, so you’ve got no excuse to not give it a shot.",
            "Pansotti are a self-fulfilling prophecy. Meaning ‘pot-bellied’, pack too many of these bad boys away and you’ll start to resemble what you eat. There are a few different ways to fold pansotti, but we’ve opted for a simple half fold, rather than also wrapping the edges around to meet. This is the pasta equivalent of standing up straight and sucking your gut in for a photo, as opposed to slouching in the armchair.",
            "The filling for this pasta is a sort of choose-your-own-bitter-green-adventure, then mix it with ricotta kind of affair. Pansotti are traditionally filled with a mix of Ligurian greens: things like chicory, nettles, and borage. But if you don’t have a nearby field to wander into and forage from, try substituting with things like chard, radicchio, and endive. We tend to use whatever’s growing out the back and looking fresh at the market, so this time around it was a perfect, peppery mix of rainbow chard, radicchio, mustard greens, and marjoram. Always go easy on that marjoram, otherwise the unassuming but plucky little thing will dominate all of the other ingredients.",
            "This week’s actual dough is a fairly standard mix of 1 egg to 100g of flour, with an extra bit of yolk thrown in. Roll that out to a medium-thin thickness of 5-6 on the pasta machine, cut it into squares of around 70mm, and then dollop or squeeze in the filling before folding one corner over to its opposite and sealing.",

            "Remember to substitute wherever needed. You can use a different dough, maybe like our paccheri or tortiglioni, different greens, even different nuts. Cook it with care and love and you’ll have yourself one fine plate of pasta. Buon appetito!",

            "One of the most common cuts of meat growing up was the trusty osso buco. It’s an Italian classic. Along with those irresistible thin Italian sausages and finely-sliced girello, it was the reason for semi-regular hour and a half round trips to the butcher on the other side of town. You can’t trust just any old butcher with your meat. Particularly if you’re an Italian family with fiercely baseless providore allegiances.",
            "Osso buco, or cross-cut veal or beef shanks, have become rather fashionable, but objectively they’re a tough cut of meat with a huge bone in the middle. So turning them into a ragu is simple, but requires time. Start off by patting them dry and dredging them in flour. If you’ve made a mess preparing your pasta, just gather up and use whatever’s left over from that.",
            "Whenever we create a soffritto like this, we tend to work with what’s in the fridge and growing out the back, so this week we substituted fennel for the usual celery that we were missing. Chop everything up fairly roughly, and then stick it in a cold pot with a generous glug of oil.",
            "There are some who swear that osso buco should have no tomatoes in it, only broth. We, perhaps with our typical southern Italian bent, used to make it with no broth and all of the tomatoes. So as a bit of a compromise this week, we’ve gone with a little of both. Much to my delight, I found a half litre of bone broth from our fagottini deep in the freezer! That bone broth just keeps giving.",
            "Once the soffritto is ready, stir in your two tablespoons of tomato paste and cook for a couple of minutes before deglazing with the white wine. Then add in the bay leaves and the bone broth, before bringing to the boil and transferring to the oven. Make sure that you keep an eye on moisture levels as it cooks, and toss in a bit of water if it’s looking too dry. After around 3 hours, the meat should be falling off the bone.",
            "Osso buco is more traditionally served with risotto or polenta, but we made this specifically with pasta in mind. As such, to ensure that it combined properly, we poked it apart with a wooden spoon and stirred the marrow through.",
            "Finally, this dish wouldn’t be complete without a quick gremolata. Just chop together the parsley, lemon zest and juice, and garlic, and serve on top. I was in the mood for a wetter gremolata, so I simply (and controversially) blitzed it all briefly with the stick blender.",
            "Our osso buco was cooked up to pair with our earthy wholemeal spelt gemelli, and it made for one delicious, hearty bowl of pasta! Remember to keep a little of that cooking water aside to assist emulsification when you toss the pasta and sauce together.",

            "Our pals at Rio Vista Olives sent us the incredible oil that we cook with in this post. Like everything that we recommend on our blog, we use and love their products, and hope that you will too!",
            "Last week we tried to escape the mists and frosts of winter with a little touch of the seaside, but this week we’re embracing it. Or at least trudging on, bolstered by a hearty bowl of chewy wholemeal spelt gemelli. Their twisty texture and earthy flavour makes for a fortifying plate of pasta, whether it’s stirred through a hearty ragu, or tossed with a bit of butter and pepper.",
            "Despite their initial appearance and name, meaning ‘twins’, gemelli are traditionally made from single strands of pasta, folded in half and then twisted around themselves. We’re not too invested in tradition though, and decided to save a bit of time by chopping ours from longer rolled pieces. We also changed things up a bit by using equal amounts of wholemeal spelt to bread flour, giving us a bold, tasty pasta to pair with a hearty ragu. This is another flour and water classic, made entirely by hand; so leave your tools in the drawer, put on your favourite pasta-making playlist, and roll up your sleeves.",
            "This recipe is similar to our cassarecce, and starts off like all good pasta should: mix the flour and water into a ball, and then knead for 10 minutes. Rest it in an airtight container away from heat or direct sunlight for another 30. Note that the high percentage of wholemeal spelt in this pasta does make it a more difficult dough to work with, so if you’re not quite up for a challenge, replace 25-75% of the spelt flour with 00 flour.",
            "To speed things along, we passed the dough through the pasta machine’s widest setting a few times, before chopping across the resulting sheet. This left us with wide strips that we then rolled by hand into long pieces of pasta. You can just as easily use a rolling pin though, or skip that step entirely and divide the main ball of dough into smaller sausages with your hands.",
            "Lengthen these out into thin strands of pasta by rolling each piece back and forwards as you move your hands gradually outwards from the centre. If you have trouble getting the pasta to sufficiently grip the board, give it a light spritz of water.",
            "Once you’ve formed your long pasta pieces, fold them in half. Then, anchoring one end under one hand, roll the other end away from you, causing the pasta to twist around itself. Chop it up to lengths of 5-6cm, and transfer to a baking paper lined tray.",
            "Little Al and I made this to serve with a hearty osso buco, and we heartily recommend that you do the same! It definitely hit the spot. You can find the recipe here.",
            "One final tip: this is a pasta best made with passion rather than precision! Mindful cooking doesn’t have to be perfect cooking, so don’t stress if you end up with a batch of gemelli all-sorts.",
            "Have fun, and buon appetito!",

            "Our pals at Rio Vista Olives sent us the incredible oil that we cook with in this post. Like everything that we recommend on our blog, we use and love their products, and hope that you will too!",
            "Two of the clearest and most joyful memories that I have of my first visit to Italy, when I was four, are of me loudly pretending that I was being kidnapped as my dad tried to load me into the car across from the Colosseum, and sitting in the back seat of a cousin’s car as we hurtled through acres of olive trees in my nonna’s hometown of Melicuccà.",
            "I’d grown up on olive oil, and loved it from a young age, so I was fascinated staring out of the window and seeing endless sloping fields of sagging nets, loaded with the olives that would be turned into that oil.",
            "Extra virgin olive oil is still at the absolute centre of our cooking world. Not a day goes by without that familiar glug. And we truly include it as its own celebrated ingredient, not just as ‘an oil’ or something to fry other stuff in. It would therefore be an understatement to say that we were excited to receive a box of extra virgin olive oil from the lovely Rio Vista Olives. Little Al, who is currently exhibiting an enthusiastic interest in oil, was losing his mind as we unpacked them, manically yelling “oioioioioioi” (his word for “oil”) with each bottle. Fine, we were all yelling that, but he started it.",
            "In short, this oil is incredible and Rio Vista are our kind of people. They love and care about what they make, they’re a family business, and their oil varieties read like a fine wine list. We might be a very different kind of operation, a long way away, but our passion and values are shared. So we read up, tried some oil, ate a lot of salumi, and took some notes. Introducing our current obsession, complete with entirely unqualified tasting notes.",
            "Now, to the pasta. If there’s one person as mad about evoo as us, it’s my Ma (Little Al’s nonna). As a kid, she’d sneak out of bed to pinch a bit of bread and oil from the pantry, and she was the one that taught me to never compromise on that huge hit of oil that starts off most of our sauces (it’s the undisputed backbone of the dish). In these strange times, and living on opposite sides of the country to each other, I can’t remember the last time that I made you pasta, Ma; so this dish, with your favourite fried little fish, is dreamed up and cooked for you. Thank you for always having me by your side in the kitchen. We’ll share this together one day soon.",
            "This week it’s a play on the traditional linguine-seafood pairing. We’ve turned two doughs into one pasta! Laminated together, we’ve got squid ink on one side, and lemon zest on the other. The subtle flavours of sea and citrus alongside each other are just meant to be. For the dough, the sauce, and the final plating, we’ve used Rio Vista Olives’ single variety Kalamata oil. It’s such a full, bright, impassioned flavour on its own that you’ll be sad to stir it into everything else (until you taste it shining through in the final dish).",
            "The process to make this pasta is really the same as always, except that you’ll be forming two balls of dough (and you might want to give some extra thought to the surface that you work that squid ink on). After you’ve mixed, kneaded, rested, and rolled, take each sheet of pasta a little thinner than you want your final linguine to be (to around 6). Lay a sheet of one dough on top of a sheet of the other, crank that machine wide open again (2-3), and then step back up to a 5. Of course, if you’re working by hand, ignore all of that, and just keep rolling. Little Al and I also made a small batch entirely by hand to taste our oils with, and it was just as good!",
            "To cut, lightly flour each sheet and fold it over itself, rolling away from you. Then chop it up to a width of about 4mm. This is the easiest method, but can result in slightly zigzagged edges. Alternatively, you can just free-hand long strips; this method is a bit tricker than with say our pappardelle, which is much wider, but you will be able to achieve straighter edges on your pasta.",
            "We headed off to the markets to buy some whitebait, and were taken by these gorgeous, fresh and cleaned silver fish. They’re technically whitebait (referring to all immature edible fish), but in this case one particular variety, all cleaned up and marketed as silver fish. If you’ve never tried whitebait before, you’re missing out: they’re cheap, nutritious, delicious, and easy to cook.",
            "Dredge them lightly but thoroughly in any left over pasta flour and then fry them up in that extra virgin olive oil. After 30 seconds or so, they should have turned white and begun to crumble. Remove them from the heat and then add the whole garlic and chillies.",
            "I am mad about these yellow fefferoni chillies – they’re one of those flavours from my childhood – and I could have cried at the smell of all this when it hit the pan. In fact, we all cried a bit, and the rest of the family had to evacuate as the lower floor was enveloped by a cloud of stovetop pepper spray.",
            "Next up is garum. This is a fascinating ingredient. It’s essentially Roman fish sauce (although may have been first used by the Greeks and Phoenicians as early as the 5th century BCE), rich in umami and fermented anchovy goodness. They were nuts about the stuff, and added it to all kinds of things, even wine and drinking water. Like its convergent food evolution cousins, garum was made by fermenting a mix of salted fish guts in the sun for a few months (the right amount of salt allowing a delicious flavour to develop with putrefaction). We’re splashing a touch of it in with our white wine to keep the sauce itself light, but add a little depth to the flavour.",
            "Fun fact, while I was checking my sources I discovered that the gunky paste left behind from straining the liquid garum was called ‘allec’. So I almost share my name with a two and a half thousand year old stinky by-product of fermented fish innards. My brother’s going to love this.",
            "Once that’s simmered for a bit, throw your cooked pasta in with the whitebait, a touch of pasta water, and a splash of lemon juice. Give it a toss, and then serve it up with finely chopped parsley, large salt crystals (we used Black Sea crystals coloured with vegetable carbon), and a crack of black pepper. Perfetto!",

Their grooves will collect and cling to all kinds of delicious things, but in this case it’s our all-star cast of tiny pork and veal meatballs, nduja, cacciatore Calabrese, hard-boiled eggs, provolone, romano, chilli, tomatoes, and a big old handful of spice. I’m drooling a little bit reading back over my own list of ingredients. Let’s get into it.",
            "This pasta dough is another of our egg and yolk recipes, and in fact you might remember a very similar ratio in our paccheri. These tortiglioni are kind of smaller, ridged versions of them.",
            "Once you’ve combined your well of ingredients into a ball, given it 10 minutes of kneading and 30 minutes of resting, remember to roll it through the pasta machine a few times (folding over itself in between passes) before getting down to business.",
            "Step it incrementally through to a thickness of 6, and then cut each sheet into rectangles of about 60mm width, and 70mm length. Note that these measurements were customised for a piece of dowel that we found in the garage, with a 14mm diameter. If you’re using a different sized object to wrap the pasta around, find yourself a piece of paper or spare bit of dough to determine how wide your rectangles should be before you start cutting.",
            "Working with one piece at a time, wrap your rectangles around the dowel, running a wet finger along the underside of the top overlapping edge if it’s not sticking by itself.",
            "Then just roll that little thing across your gnocchi board, with the grooves running parallel to the long edge of the pasta. Start on the dough overlap and roll towards the exposed edge to ensure that the seal remains.",
            "Transfer to baking paper lined trays, standing up if possible to maintain the shape. Tip: we stand ours up in tall cake tins, nice and close to each other, to make transport easier! Transfer uncovered to the fridge for up to a week. The longer you leave them, the better the bite they’ll develop.",
            "It doesn’t get much more Calabrese than nduja. Maybe I’m biased through some sort of genetic predisposition, but this may be the single greatest food stuff ever created. It has spice, heat, smokiness, texture, and pork. All of these familiar qualities of southern Italian food, rolled into one incredible, spreadable paste. If you want Calabria in a mouthful, get some nduja in ya.",
            "Now, for full disclosure, it was harder to get a hold of these true regional foods when I was a kid, so I developed an equally fierce passion for your more standard cured meats and sliceable salamis. Chopped and mixed through a pasta bake, or rolled inside a giant meatball, these firm and chewy little punches of flavour are tiny bits of nostalgia. So for our pasta bake, torn by indecision (not really), we used both! This time around we opted for cacciatore Calabrese, but you can swap this for any hard, spicy salami.",
            "For all the talk of egg and salami, one of the most memorable parts of my great aunty’s pasta bake was the tiny meatballs peppered throughout. These might seem like a nuisance to make, but I timed it for you, and you can crank one out every 5 seconds, including mixing time. So less than 10 minutes for 100 meatballs, which is about what this recipe makes, and I’ve even granted you a minute there to bask in your efficient meatballing glory. We talked about meatballs back in our meatballs and tomato sauce recipe, but the gist is: get your hands in there and squeeze it all messily between your fingers, before compressing and rolling it into balls.",
            "So how do you make it? Well, shallow fry those meatballs, remove them to make your soffritto in the same oil, then put them back in with the tomatoes for 20 minutes. Simple! Stir in the cacciatore, hard boil the eggs, blanch the pasta, and you’re ready to begin construction.",
            "Similar to building a lasagne, start with a wet layer of sauce and pasta, before layering with chunks of nduja, provolone, romano, and egg; repeat that until it’s all used up. This recipe will fill a 20x30cm dish, with 4-5 layers. Bake for half an hour, until the exposed pasta begins to darken or you are overcome by excessive mouth watering.",

            "Sausages are fantastic; what more is there to say? They’re a self-contained, considered balance of meat, fat, and spice. I can relate. And they’re versatile: as perfect slow-cooked in a stew or sauce as they are grilled and rolled up in a slice of white bread. Think of this deliberately uncomplicated pasta sauce as a celebration of the sausage-maker and their hard work. Or at least a really quick way to make a very flavourful ragu. Squeeze it out, fry it up, and add some tomatoes!",
            "A modest but tasty pasta like our casarecce goes perfectly with this sort of hearty sauce, but you can serve it with pretty much anything that takes your fancy. Snowed under, of course, with a generous amount of cheese.",
            "Whilst the beauty of this sauce is in its delicious sausagey shortcut, so too is its potential undoing. So choose your sausage wisely! Sometimes I’ll recreate those sausage flavours by freshly grinding some mince and mixing it with an assortment of things like sage, fennel seeds, thyme, rosemary, paprika, and garlic powder. But it’s not quite the same, and obviously defeats the time efficiency and matured flavour aspects of using sausages in the first place. I absolutely love those thin, firm Italian sausages, but this time went for something a little juicier. Make friends with your butcher and get adventurous!",
            "Start off by frying up rough chunks of sausage meat. The messier the better! Unpredictable, jagged edges and crispy little peaks will give the sauce a fantastic texture.",
            "Once you’ve added in all of your other ingredients, bring it to the boil and transfer the pot to the oven, uncovered. I find that this gives the sauce a real flavour boost, particularly if you don’t have enough time to slowly cook it down on the stove. Even after only 20 minutes, you’ll see a mouth-watering glossiness develop on the surface as the oil begins to separate.",
            "And if you’d like to make an even richer sauce using this method, simply increase the water component and cook it for longer in the oven. If you do so, you might want to check and adjust the water levels every now and then, giving it a stir at the same time. Partially cover it to draw that cooking time out even further.",
            "Then it’s just a matter of boiling up your pasta; this time around, we made casarecce! Remember to retain some of the cooking water, as you might find it useful in emulsifying the sauce as you stir the pasta through it.

            "When we first decided to turn our little pasta tradition into a blog, posting a different pasta each week or so, I thought it would be a good idea to list out every type of pasta I could think of and make sure that we had enough weeks in us. As I approached 100 I decided we’d be fine. Then when, with a little additional research, I discovered that there are actually an estimated 350 varieties out there, not including all regional adaptations, creative interpretations, or dough and filling substitutions, I had a little panic. Even if you allow only 3 variations per pasta, Pasta et Al has at least 20 years’ worth of pasta to guide you through. At that point I did some wordless muttering and walked away from my notes in a bit of a daze.",
            "Then I made pappardelle. If there’s one pasta that never fails to hit the spot, as a solid bitey mouthful undoubtedly bearing a hearty sugo, it’s pappardelle. Despite the endless types of pasta out there, once I develop a craving for this guy, nothing can throw me off the scent. And as a handcut pasta that can be made with or without eggs, using little more than a rolling implement and a knife, this should be one of your unshakeable go-tos. I’ve made it before with a plastic water bottle and a pocket-knife. I have no time for your excuses.",
            "It’s not just me either. There’s a lot in a pasta name: tagliatelle from ‘to cut’, paccheri from ‘to slap’, strozzapreti (love this one) ‘choking priest’, linguine ‘little tongues’, orecchiette ‘little ears’. Pappardelle is from the Latin ‘to gobble up with delight’. Because for as long as there’s been pasta, pappardelle has held this allure of gastronomic fulfilment. Due to its width and durability, you can do all sorts of creative things with it: mix in herbs and spice, laminate ingredients, colour it, emboss it. Sometimes though the best way to celebrate such a triumph of design is to keep it simple. With a dash of decadence thrown in. This is our egg yolk pappardelle.",
            "You’re going to need a lot of eggs. More specifically, a lot of egg yolks. If you love omelettes or macarons then you’re in luck, because a two person serve of this little indulgence will set you back 9 eggs and leave you as many whites. I’ve mentioned before that I separate my yolks by passing them back and forth between the cracked shell halves; if you do this over a bowl then you can just let the whites fall through and then package them up for refrigeration or freezing. If you are drawn to the macaron challenge, make sure that you don’t let any cheeky yolk slip in. I may have picked up a thing or two about baked goods over the years, and I can tell you that with yolks in your meringue egg whites, you’re going to have a bad time.",
            "Now get your flour well on. This time around you’re going to need more of a city ramparts than a well to contain all those yolks. I’m not going to lie, I regularly make a proper mess at this mixing stage, and so I keep a scraper handy to regather it all as I go. Once you’ve formed it into a rough ball, start your 10 minutes of vigorous kneading.",
            "Remember that you don’t want it sticking to your hands or the kneading surface, and you should be able to gauge this within a few minutes of beginning work on the dough. Just add flour a little bit at a time if it’s too sticky and be careful not to go overboard (it’s harder going back the other way to incorporate extra moisture). I always find that the dough noticeably ‘turns’ at around 6-7 minutes. By 10, you should have a beautiful shiny, smooth dough. Place it in an airtight container and leave it to rest away from direct sunlight or heat for 30 minutes.",
            "For ease of dough management, cut it into 4 pieces, leaving those that you’re not working on sealed up. I use a pasta machine to incrementally roll my pappardelle through to a setting of 5. You may want to go thinner, but remember that this is a pasta well suited to a bit of thickness. If you’re just using a rolling pin, aim for a final thickness of somewhere between 1.5 and 2mm. Remember that if you’re using a machine you should always pass the dough through on the widest setting a few times (folding over itself in between) before you start stepping through the settings. This effectively extends the knead time and helps develop those gluten bonds; working with a pin, a quick knead before rolling will have a similar effect.",
            "We cut our pappardelle to around 30cm in length, with a width of about an inch. On an average sheet of machined dough (about 140mm wide) that should get you 5 lengths of pasta. That said, I sometimes like to go extra-wide and cut only four per sheet. You can either use a cutting roller for this or lightly flour each sheet, fold it gently over itself, and cut across it with a knife. Then unfold each piece, and hang it to dry on a rack (alternatively, transfer it to a baking paper lined tray). If you’re cutting with a knife, try to stay as straight as possible; there’s nothing wrong with zigzagging pasta, but it might not be what you’re after.",
            "Store this pasta uncovered in the fridge for at least half an hour to gain a bit of bite. It will keep refrigerated for up to a week. Cook it in plenty of water, always to al dente, and until there’s no white left in the dough when you bite it!",
            "That’s it! Short and sweet. If you’re looking for the perfect sauce to accompany this glorious, rich celebration of a pasta, we’ve got the recipe for you: be sure to check out our mushroom and taleggio sauce. They were made to go together.",

                    "Prepare your eggs yolks. The easiest way that I've found to separate them is to crack each egg in half and then pass the yolk back and forwards between the halves, allowing the white to fall away. Remember that those egg whites will store well (and can be frozen), so you can always keep them for future use. Add the yolks to the centre of the well, with the olive oil.",
                    "Use a fork or your hand to gradually mix the dry ingredients into the wet, in the centre of the well. You want to form a ball of dough that’s elastic, but doesn’t stick to your hands or work surface. If it’s too sticky, add flour in very small amounts (no more than a tablespoon at a time).",
                    "Once the dough can be handled without sticking to anything, knead vigourously for 10 minutes. Put your weight down and forwards into the dough using the heel of your hand, and fold it forwards over itself as you go. The motion is down, forwards, and then up at the end of the push.",
                    "After 10 minutes, if you’ve balanced your moisture correctly you should be left with a smooth, shiny ball of dough that requires no additional flour.",
                    "Store it in a freezer bag or similar to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes, keeping it out of direct sunlight or heat to avoid it sweating.",
                    "Cut the dough into four pieces, and roll it out. For pappardelle, I like to go thicker; if using a machine, I roll to 5. Remember on a machine to pass it through at the lowest setting a few times first, folding it over itself in between passes. Then step up incrementally to your desired thickness. I aim for sheets of around 30cm in length. If you're using a rolling pin, you can cut to whatever width you like, or use the machine width of 14cm as a guide.",
                    "Use a knife or cutting roller to cut the sheets into wide strips, of around two fingers width. If you find it easier, you can flour the sheets well and then roll them loosely over themselves before cutting; this makes for less distance that your knife has to travel. Just make sure that you unroll after cutting each sheet.",
                    "Refrigerate for 30 minutes to a week, uncovered. This will help it dry out and enhance the bite when eating.",
                    "To cook, boil in plenty of water, and bite or cut across the pasta to check that it's cooked. No sign of floury white (but only just) is what you want. If you're after the ideal, creamy, pairing for this pasta, try  our mushroom and taleggio sauce !"

            "The worst kept secret of the pasta world is that for all of the incredible, complex, layered sauces out there, there is no pasta that can’t be enjoyed with just a chunk of butter and a crack of pepper. Whenever we got home especially late after school, and everyone was exhausted, it was hard to hide our delight at the suggestion of plain old pasta with butter. I’m talking serious lazy food here: just a lump of cold butter stirred through warm pasta until it melted. Maybe a handful of grated cheese on top, and some pepper if we were in a gourmet kind of mood. And it was the best.",
            "I guess the truth of it is that a good pasta sauce is always simple. Even if there are a heap of ingredients that go into it, the success of the sauce is in how it complements but never overshadows the pasta. It’s why we pair flavourful ravioli with a light tomato sauce, or why we give our paccheri extra bite and structure if we’re going to pack them with a hearty ragu. And there’s nothing simpler than butter.",
            "Tempting though it is for my own amusement, I’m not going to give you a recipe that requires one ingredient and no cooking. Instead, it needs 3 ingredients, and 3 minutes in a pan. We first made this to go with our red dragonfruit tortelli on Mother’s Day, and it was the perfect match. Like, the whole dish was extraordinarily delicious, even if I do say so myself. To pair with the fruitiness of the lemon and dragonfruit, but also offset some of the sweetness, we chose a simple herb pairing of lemon thyme and pink peppercorns. The thyme was perfect in lifting the richness of the brown butter, and the pink peppercorns? Just all round damn fine. They have a tangy heat, and a floral tone, and are my current favourite ingredient.",
            "You can also substitute the thyme and pink peppercorns for all kinds of other excellent things, like rosemary, sage, oregano. You’re still going to have a good time, just maybe not as good a thyme as you would with pink peppercorns.",
            "So… Brown butter? It’s awesome. If you’ve never done it, you’re missing out on a great way to make other people who haven’t done it think that you’re better than you are in the kitchen. And also adding some instant nutty depth of flavour to your dish, etc.",
            "Essentially, butter is mostly fat (around 80%), sitting in water, with a small 1-2% of milk protein (whey and casein). Teeny bit of lactose too that kicks off the whole browning process. Those proteins have a lower smoke point than the fats, and they’re what you’re trying to brown, but they’re staying pasty as long as the fats are bobbing around chilling in all that water. So when you heat your butter, you’re first evaporating the water; once this is gone the fats can heat up and start to brown the proteins. Brown butter. Science.",
            "I brown my butter on medium-high heat, stirring constantly. You’ll see it bubble, then foam, and once that white foam’s gone the rate of browning will really pick up. So you’ll want to throw in your other ingredients while there’s still white stuff floating around (for a little more control over how they’re cooked), and keep a close eye on it from there. There’s no wrong degree of browning until you’ve suddenly burnt it, so if you’re not sure just keep tasting, and be ready to pour it out of the pan when it’s done, otherwise it’ll continue to cook. And don’t strain out those brown specks! They’re half of the flavour!",
            "If you want to jar it up and fridge it, this tasty thing will resolidify and can be melted again in future. But if you’re ready to eat, reintroduce it to your now-cooled pan, warm it back up slightly, and toss your pasta in. Or if you want to do it old-school, stir it straight into a bowl of hot pasta!",
            "Because it’s Mother’s Day, we decided to finish it off with some edible flowers. Little Al helped build this planter and then immediately assumed command of it.",
            "This was a sauce dreamed up to specifically complement our red dragonfruit tortelli, and it was amazing; check it out!",
            "That said, it’s also very versatile, so play around with it, change up the herbs, and try it with all kinds of pasta.",

She’s the backbone of the house, knows us better than we know ourselves, and has effortlessly become the greatest Mamma of all time. When we talk about sitting down to pasta with the family, she is the family.",
            "And to my own Ma, little Al’s Nonna, I’ll never be able to repay you for everything that you’ve given me. We’ve been on opposite sides of the country for so long now, but you’re always in my thoughts.",
            "Now to pasta. Both of these women know well that I enjoy generating a bit of controversy. In fact, whether they’ll admit it or not, they’ve always encouraged that in me. So here we are, red dragonfruit tortelli with ricotta and lemon filling.",
            "Last week little Al and I went out on a mission gathering unusual things to try mixing into our pasta dough. We picked up a range of powdered foods to use for colour and flavour, like chlorella and activated charcoal, but perhaps most controversially we bought some red dragonfruit (pink pitaya) powder. Now hear me out: two points. Firstly, if it’s done with care and consideration, fruit can always be subtly added into savoury dishes, even if it’s not a traditional pairing. Secondly, this is our blog, and we’ll do what we want.",
            "Anyway, I’m going to say up front that I hadn’t expected this to be as good as it was. There it is, I’ve said it. To be honest, I would have denied the entire culinary experiment if it had turned out less than amazing, but whatever. Tossed through our brown butter with pink peppercorns and lemon thyme, this was freaking delicious.",
            "We experimented with various amounts of red dragonfruit powder before settling on our preferred ratio to flour. Adding more gave it a fantastic deep purple colour, but the eventual winner for us was a more subtly flavoured pink dough.",
            "A crack of black pepper in the filling perfectly offset that little bit of fruitiness, and paired with our simple sauce of brown butter and pink peppercorns, we had a new dish worth blogging about!",
            "I don’t normally recommend a food processor for pasta, unless you’re in a tearing hurry, but I found that the dragonfruit powder clumped a bit as the dough came together. If you give everything a blitz for a minute you should get a beautifully uniform dough, with tiny dark flecks through it. Of course, you can easily do this by hand – when I tested it out I just found that that the incorporation of ingredients required a little more attention. Regardless of whether you use a food processor or not, give it the usual 10 minutes of vigorous kneading, and then bag it up to prevent drying as it rests for 30 minutes.",
            "While the dough’s hanging out, mix all of those filling ingredients together with a fork, just like nonna used to do. You’ll still have texture from the lemon zest, but there shouldn’t be any ricotta lumps. Stick it in a piping bag with a medium-sized tip, or ready a teaspoon (also like nonna, whose aversion to technology is starting to become obvious now with hindsight).",
            "Next, cut your dough up into 2-4 pieces, depending on how fast you think you can work filling and folding. Again, store what you’re not working on in an airtight container. If you’re using a pasta machine, pass it through on the thickest setting a few times, folding over itself in between passes. Then step it incrementally through to a setting of 7.",
            "Use a fluted cutter to form squares of about 60mm, and give them all a pea sized dollop of filling. It should be a little round ball that takes up the inner ninth of the square. Then to shape fold one edge over the filling to meet its opposite. Press down lightly to seal, and then gently seal the two shorter edges, making sure that you squeeze out any air as you go. Now turn the frilled edges slightly upwards, and give it a poke in the centre of the smooth sealed edge to form a hollow in the bulge caused by the filling. Bring the short edges around the hollow to slightly overlap with each other, and press firmly to seal and complete the tortello.",
            "Transfer these guys straight on to baking paper lined trays, and refrigerate for up to a day. Keeping them uncovered overnight will actually add a little bite to the cooked pasta, so if you have the time, make them the day before.",

            "Little Al has managed to inherit a few of my more ‘difficult’ personality traits, but so far there’s been no sign of the calculated, scheming mischief that defined my own childhood. The prime stone against which I honed my blade of torment was my nonna. She did have pleasant diminutive nicknames for me, but my given names may as well have been ‘delinguente’ and ‘scustamato’ for their frequency and familiarity. The only reliable occasions for a truce were visiting my nonno at the cemetery (I needed her to lift me up so that I could kiss his photo), the imminent arrival of my mum to collect me up from her house (I needed her to hastily ‘make friends’ after a day of relentless wooden spoon pursuit), and making pasta. Ravioli was our signature dish, and it’s become the signature dish of our new little family.",
            "You might remember the dough from our spinach fettuccine recipe, and the story that went with that. My nonna and I would make huge amounts of these ravioli to package up for the whole family, popping them out until we ran out of filling, and then making fettuccine with the leftover dough. It was a ‘cooking-by-touch’ sort of approach that’s left us now, through years of trial and error and habit, with the unusual serving size of three people. If you only need it for two and aren’t up for awkwardly splitting an egg yolk, either cut down the filling by a third and use the leftover dough for a two-person serve of fettuccine, or live a little and fill that bowl to the brim. It’s good pasta – you won’t regret it.",
            "This is much like the fettucine dough, and obviously you can use either of these interchangeably. The only small changes I made for the ravioli were to slightly increase the amount of semolina to 00 flour (for a bit more hardiness, flavour, and bite), decrease the spinach (to lower the chances of any errant flecks getting in the way of the cutter), and slightly up the oil (for a little more silkiness).",
            "For the dough, I recommend getting that spinach chopped fine or pureed if possible. Regardless of how you intend to stamp out your ravioli, having a smooth fleckless dough will make life much easier. The main points remain the same for almost all doughs that we make. After you’ve combined your ingredients, make sure that you knead it firmly for 10 minutes. Add flour if required, until it no longer sticks to anything, then leave it to rest in a freezer bag or cling wrap (or any air tight container) for 30 minutes.",
            "Cut it into four pieces, rolling one at a time with the others remaining covered. This time around I rolled it with the manual hand crank machine to a thickness of 6 (this is probably thicker than most like it, but hey it’s my dinner). Make sure that you start on the thickest setting and work gradually to the thinnest. You can always step down and back up if your dough needs flouring and folding for the odd tear or two. I used to be lazy about my ratios, and use the thicker settings to finish the kneading and properly incorporate the spinach, but you’re creating more work for yourself and the end result won’t be as refined. If you’ve balanced your moisture well (see the spinach fettuccine recipe for more on this), it should be a straightforward one-directional climb up the thickness notches.",
            "This is a deliciously easy filling, particularly if you can use fresh ricotta. Again, make sure that the spinach is well chopped, and not too wet. Knead it together briefly. If you decide to use a piping bag, it’ll help to have it almost pureed, but then I enjoy the flavour of it flecked through the cheese, so it’s your call.",
            "We use big fantastic red ravioli grids to cut our pasta. You can obviously use hand stamps, or even squash them with a shot glass and cut with a knife, but we eat a lot of pasta, and these squares turn out large amounts of beautiful ravioli with lovely saggy bellies (and I’ve been using them since I was tall enough to reach the pasta table). I love these things so much that I think I’ll have to write a separate blog post about them. For now, I’ll just say that if you want to make ravioli, these will fast become your best friend!",
            "If you do use something like this (tell me about it in the comments!) just remember to flour it well. Once you’ve laid the floured bottom sheets, overlapping at the join, give them a light press to reveal the grid underneath and then spoon or pipe in small amounts of filling.",
            "Spray a light mist of water over the bare pasta, then carefully lay the top sheets, again overlapping at the join. Be sure to not seal in large pockets of air, as they’ll cause the ravioli to break when you boil them. Then just flour the top, and  roll nice and firmly to seal and cut. I don’t like to use wooden rolling pins because they get scratched up and can’t be used for rolling fondant (totally unrelated interesting story in itself). Instead I use old wine bottles. They do provide a slightly firmer pressure against the cutting edges, but the main advantage is that you can accidentally throw them out every week and be forced to buy more wine.",
            "Once you can see the cutting edge clearly, peel off the excess, flip it over, and give it a bang. However you’ve cut them, lay them out on lightly floured baking paper, and stick them in the fridge or freezer immediately. If you’ve got urgent customers waiting on delivery like Little Al’s Ravioli Delivery Service, load them straight on to your cart and get pushing.",
            "Use lots of water in a big pot to cook these. You don’t want to overcrowd them, and you don’t want that boil to vanish when you drop them in. Once they’re all floating nicely, give one a test and make sure you can’t see any white, but don’t let them go soft. Al dente or go hungry.",
            "Pair it with a light sauce and let that flavour shine through. If you’re after something super quick to toss your ravioli through, check out the recipe for our light tomato and basil sauce!",
            "This dish and tradition means a lot to us, so we hope that you enjoy it. Cook with care and love, and don’t forget the cheese!",

                    "Mix the flours together with the salt, and make a well out of them on a large flat surface, or in a bowl.",
                    "To the well, add the 80g of pureed spinach, the oil, and the 2 eggs plus 1 egg yolk. For the single yolk, I recommend cracking the egg in half and then passing the yolk back and forth between the halves, allowing the white to fall loose.",
                    "Starting in the centre, use a fork or your hand to gradually incorporate the dry ingredients into the wet. If you’ve already formed a ball of dough, but it remains sticky, keep adding flour at no more than a tablespoon at a time.",
                    "Once the dough can be handled without sticking to your fingers or the work surface, begin kneading. You may have to keep adding some flour if it you notice it getting sticky during kneading – this is very much a step best judged by feel.",
                    "To knead, I recommend putting your weight down and forwards into the dough using the heel of your hand. You are trying to roll it forwards and fold it over at the same time, so the motion is down, forwards, and then up at the end of the push. Fold the flattened dough back towards you and over itself as you repeat. You want 10 minutes of hard kneading to really develop the gluten.",
                    "After 10 minutes, as long as you eliminated any sticking early in the knead, you should be left with a smooth, shiny ball of dough that requires no additional flouring.",
                    "Seal it in a  freezer bag, or any sealable plastic , and leave it to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. Try to keep it out of direct sunlight or heat, as that will cause the dough to sweat.",
                    "While the dough rests, make the filling by mixing all filling ingredients together in a bowl. Knead it lightly together; it should hold together without being too wet. If you want to make life easy for yourself, prefill a piping bag fitted with a medium round tip. Otherwise, filling with a teaspoon and your hands will work fine, but may take a little longer.",
                    "Cut the dough into four pieces, and return to the bag all but the single piece you'll begin working on. Using a pasta roller, or rolling pin, roll out and refold the dough 4-5 times into long strips. Think of this step as an extension of the kneading process. If on a  machine , just keep putting it through the 0 setting, refolding as you go. Flour lightly if you notice it sticking, and don't worry if you get some tears – just keep refolding to cover the tears, and rerolling with a light dusting of flour. You'll notice that the dough becomes easier to handle with every pass.",
                    "Begin stepping up the settings on the  machine , or if using a rolling pin, begin rolling thinner and thinner. I roll up to a machine setting of 6, but that's a personal preference, and it may be appropriate to go thinner. If you're rolling by hand, remember to aim for long rectangular strips with a similar width to what a pasta machine would make (about 30cm by 14cm); this will ensure you can cover a ravioli grid or tray if using one, or have enough room to stamp by hand. For a grid, you could also roll out 30x30cm squares.",
                    "Flour one side of your sheets well – that will be the underside. If using  a grid or tray , lay the sheet/s across it, with a slightly water dampened overlap to join any sheets together.",
                    "On  a grid or tray , give the sheets a very light press to show an outline of the mould underneath. If using a stamp, either make very light indentations in the dough, or gauge the required spacing. Fill each raviolo with a small amount of the filling. Spritz the exposed dough with water, then overlay an appropriate number of sheets to cover the tray, depending on the mould you are using. If hand cutting, you may find it more efficient to place your filling off-centre and fold the sheet in half over it.",
                    "Flour the top of your pasta, and then begin cutting. If using a stamp, simply press down firmly over each filled mound; if using a  grid or tray , roll firmly until the cutting/sealing edge is showing through. I use a wine bottle because I find that it cuts well, and I don't end up scratching up my rolling pin. Marble pins also work well, and if you have a dedicated pasta pin there's nothing wrong with that.",
                    "Peel away any excess, and knock the ravioli free of the moulds. Separate if stamped. Transfer all ravioli to baking paper lined trays and refrigerate uncovered for up to a day. Making them the day before will give the pasta a satisfying bite.",
                    "To cook, drop into a large pot of boiling water. The more water to pasta, the less chance you’ll lose the boil when you drop the pasta in. Once they’re all floating at the surface, try one and ensure that there’s no white showing in the bite. Be sure not to overcook after all that hard work!",

            "Slow cooked meat. Oh yeah. A surefire way to a satisfying meal is simple ingredients, cooked for a long time. And meat. I remember a couple of decades back, the last giant family party that I think we had. The kind that has so many ‘uncles’ and ‘cousins’ that you’re reminded of the fact that they’re actually placeholder titles used to avoid convoluted explanations of exactly who’s brother’s great-uncle-in-law you’re talking to, and that actually you can’t remember. The type where even the less familiar hair gel and gold chain side of the family turns up. And the type with a whole lamb roasting on a giant spit, manned by an assortment of portly bristled men holding beers and shouting at each other over the smoke in beautifully broken English and Calabrian. Family events have been whittled down now by time and distance, and it’s been many years since I had room for a spit in the backyard, so our slow cooked meals these days all happen at a scale that can fit into our La Creuset pot. Though it is the biggest that we could find.",
            "Last week we bought a big old good looking piece of pork shoulder, carved some of it up for steaks, put some through the grinder to go into our polpette, and kept some aside for this ragu. We’ll never be too prescriptive in the cut of meat that we recommend, as we tend to just use what looks best and would reasonably work, but this time it was shoulder. If you want a more pulled experience, then collar butt is your cut – that’s our go to on Mexican night! Just keep in mind how dry your chosen cut will be after slow cooking and, if in doubt, ask your butcher.",
            "If you are using an enamelled cast iron pot, then you may want to brown your meat in a separate pan and then deglaze it to ensure you don’t miss out on any left-behind flavour. It’s not ideal to superheat these pots and you also run the risk of leaving behind residue that eventually catches. But it’s your call – I don’t treat it as a hard and fast rule, and it’s kind of pleasing to cook the whole thing in one pot.",
            "Here is a rule though: I personally taste all of my ingredients at all stages of preparation, and you should too!",
            "If you taste everything that goes into your dish before, during, and after preparation, then you’ll be able to understand the relationship between the ingredients and the cooking processes. Then let chaos reign as you brazenly abandon recipes and embrace empowered improvisation.",
            "One of the feature ingredients of this recipe is the wild boar bocconcini. It has a magnificent deep, earthy taste, but is still subtle in intensity. You can easily substitute it for another type of salami, but if you do happen across it, give it a shot. We may have eaten a lot off ‘offcuts’ as we sliced this up. With taleggio. And crackers. Ok fine, also a bunch of other salumi that I ‘happened to collect’ the last time I went out.",
            "Once you’ve combined your soffritto with your meat (see this post from last week if you want to read about my awkward obsession for the soffritto), throw in the rest of the ingredients. Make sure that you swill that water around in any tomato tins and bottles you’re using to grab every last bit, and as a wise chef once said, only cook with wine that you’d enjoy drinking. You’ll even have four hours to enjoy the rest of it while you wait for your ragu to cook.",
            "Then cover it up and get that pot in the oven! As long as you’re monitoring the moisture levels, with the occasional stir, the longer you cook this bad boy the better. If it’s getting too dry, just add water. Don’t be afraid to also adjust the temperature, or even remove the lid if it’s looking too wet. By the time the sauce is cooked, the meat should be breaking up with every stir. Perfect for stuffing into our hand-rolled paccheri! Load it up with a punchy hard cheese and pepper, and have yourself a fine meal.",

            "Yawn. Alright, the pasta. Paccheri is one of those pastas that tastes as good as it sounds. It’s a rough old guy from Campania, with a name derived from the Neapolitan ‘to slap’, and a legend of being used to smuggle garlic into Prussia during the Middle Ages. You don’t have to stuff paccheri, as their large bitey nature is satisfying with just about any sauce, but if you have the time and inclination, they are a great one to pack with ragu. Think of them as the lucky rigatoni that you occasionally happen across perfectly filled with a hearty mouthful of sauce; except they’re huge and every single one is loaded!",
            "We’ve already gone off-piste by rolling it, so why not mix it up by throwing in some eggs? One of the beauties of pasta is that you can decide what you want the end result to be, and then build your recipe accordingly. For these paccheri, we wanted them to be smooth and supple enough to shape by hand, but also firm enough to stuff with a meaty ragu. So we’ve gone with equal numbers of eggs and egg yolks, and also added in a little coarse semolina.",
            "As with all of our dough, start by gently incorporating the wet ingredients into the dry, eventually forming it into a ball that has a nice spring to it without sticking to your hand or the bench. Remember that you may need to add more flour than the recipe calls for – do this only in small tablespoon quantities, incorporating fully before adding more. Likewise, if it’s too dry be careful adding water. I only ever wet a few fingers and work that through the dough, rather than measuring in any more substantial quantities. Do the time, and knead vigorously for 10 minutes, then rest it for 30.",
            "There’s a bit more table work for this one than last week’s fettuccine, so make sure that you’ve got some flour at hand to sprinkle about as needed. You’ll also need some sort of dowel to form the paccheri around. Al and I found an offcut in the garage and just gave it a quick sand. I’m sure that if you hunted around properly you’d find a recommended paccheri diameter, but we just eyeballed things around the house imagining how much ragu you’d be able to stuff in… In this case ours are 20mm in diameter. Remember that the diameter of whatever implement you choose will determine the length of your pre-rolled pasta rectangles.",
            "If you’re using a rolling pin to make your initial sheets, give the dough an extra knead before you begin, otherwise pass it through the machine on the thickest setting a few times, folding it over itself in between. Step it gradually through to your desired thickness, which for us this time was 6 on our Marcato. The weather was kind to us, not too dry, so we actually cut our rectangles in big batches before shaping and sealing them into paccheri. You won’t always have this luxury, so be prepared with cling wrap/plastic bags and tea towels to cover both unused dough and cut rectangles that are awaiting rolling.",
            "Now, a word on cutting precision… We don’t ever use rulers to measure or cut; that’s why a lot of our measurements are given in fingers (important note, these are my fingers, not little Al’s – unless you want tiny, tiny pasta), and why our pasta is not always perfectly neat and uniform. That said, there’s nothing wrong with a bit of ruler work if you can’t abide the odd wonky piece. Do whatever works for you, but try not to take it too seriously!",
            "Using your dowel as a guide, determine how long your rectangles should be. You want them to overlap by a few millimeters to ensure that they seal, but not so much that they bulk up. Make sure that you’ve floured whatever you’re using to form the pasta, and then wrap the rectangles around it one at a time, using a light brushing of water to seal the pasta as it folds back over itself (I just use my finger). You can spray a mist if you prefer, but be careful to not wet the dowel as you’ll never be able to release your beautiful new paccheri!",
            "Stand these guys up on baking paper lined trays as you make them. This will ensure that they don’t collapse as they dry. As always, transfer to the fridge uncovered for up to a week. Yes, they’ll probably fall over and make a nuisance of themselves in the process, so just judge whether they’re firm enough by that point to hold their shape laying down.",
            "This is a satisfying pasta regardless of what you serve it with, but we highly recommend packing it with big chunks of meat and covering it in cheese. Check out our pork shoulder ragu for the ultimate sauce pairing!",
            "As always, make it with love, and enjoy.",

            "Here’s one that comes from the heart. This is our signature family sugo: meatballs in tomato sauce. It’s the sauce that bubbled away quietly in the background every Sunday, filling the house with delicious anticipation; it’s the sauce that simply holds everything together. In fact, when I talk about pasta and what it means to me, this is the sugo that I think of. Pair it with our spinach fettuccine, as we always served it, and you have the ultimate comfort food.",
            "Little Al is primary stirrer for this dish, and also provides valuable quality control as the sauce cooks, so while he’s busy handling that I’ll give you a run down on how to make this delicious but simple sauce for yourself. Meatballs have been rolled in this house for as long as pasta, so it’s a strange experience for me to actually write down a recipe for it… But here goes!",
            "First things first, this sauce is all about the soffritto. You put in the time and care at the beginning, and you will be rewarded with a better product down the line. Just like raising children. I must insist that anyone following this recipe gives the onion and garlic 30 minutes on the lowest heat, stirring constantly, until it’s translucent. You also need lots of olive oil. As in, put in what you think will be enough, and then look the other way as you splash in a good glug more (this is why we buy in bulk). Think of olive oil as a beautiful ingredient in its own right, not just some sucker that you fry other ingredients in. And start it all in a cold pot! Don’t ask me why – it just works. If you’re serious about your slow-cooked flavour, we recommend investing in an enamelled cast iron pot – you just can’t beat the taste. Now, it’s likely not a real cooking technique, but I also often take my soffritto off the heat entirely a few times as I cook it. The sweating and resting without heat seems to help it along. But I can’t support that with science.",
            "Once my soffritto’s ready, I raise the temperature, and bruise and throw in my basil. We used to drop the basil in after the tomatoes, but I think you get a slightly punchier flavour if it fries quickly. Add in your passata with a good pinch of salt, and a good pinch of sugar. If you’ve done the right thing by yourself and those about to eat your pasta, then you’ll see the oil nicely separated from the sauce. Give it a good stir and then cover to bring to a gentle boil.",
            "For the meatballs, just throw everything in a bowl and get in there with your hands. We like to mince our own pork and beef, as it allows us to choose the best meat. Often we’ll grab a big piece, cut off some chunks or steaks, grind some mince, and make a broth with the bones. Grab yourself a Kitchenaid grinder attachment and you’ll never be disappointed to find the butcher’s out of mince.",
            "Knead the meatball mix like dough, and let it squeeze between your fingers. This time around I didn’t have breadcrumbs so I soaked a piece of freshly baked bread in water. Because I also didn’t have milk. It’s arrangiarsi, leave me alone.",
            "To shape the meatballs, give them a firm squeeze between your cupped hands and compress the ingredients together. Then roll and turn them gently in your palms until they’re smooth spheres.",
            "Now, I don’t fry or brown my meatballs at all, I just drop them into the sauce. I know it’s controversial, but that’s how we like it. Then gently rotate the pot back and forth like a steering wheel to let the meatballs settle (I don’t like to get the wooden spoon in there until the meatballs have firmed up a bit), and leave it to simmer for as long as possible, at least 3.5 hours. Check in regularly with a stir. You’ll know you’ve nailed it when you peer in and see delicious separation between tomato and oil. Yep, that is the business.",
            "Always use lots of water when you’re cooking your pasta (so that you maintain the boil when you add the pasta) and remember to salt it. Drop the pasta in and test a piece when it’s all floating comfy at the surface. It shouldn’t have any white showing on the inside (but only just) and should have a nice firm al dente bite to it. Always stir the sauce through the pasta before plating, and don’t forget plenty of hard aged cheese on top!",

            "These days I make all kinds of pasta with all kinds of dough, but when I was a kid there were only four types. Don’t get me wrong, we enjoyed plenty of packet pasta – secretly but unanimously excited as my nonna apologised for the rigatoni she was opening –  but when we did it ourselves, our repertoire was deliberately and appropriately limited. We made spinach and ricotta ravioli, always with spinach dough, and we made spinach fettuccine with the leftovers. On occasion we’d roll out some plain dough lasagna, sometimes gnocchi, but for the most part we were a green pasta family. To this day, the only dough that truly tastes ‘right’ to me is freshly made spinach.",
            "I’d mostly graduated from old nonna’s scuola di cucina (or at least been finally expelled) by the time my brother and cousins arrived to bolster the workforce, but in the years before school and on the weekends until they could plausibly turn a pasta handle, I would stand for hours beside my nonna churning out ludicrous amounts of pasta for the extended family, usually to last months at a time. And months at a time, in a Italian family, equates to a significant amount of pasta. I don’t mean to claim any sort of mystical pasta knowledge gleaned from days at a time spent staring into pasta sheets, but it did teach me how to cook by taste and feel. Nonna’s ‘recipes’ were along the lines of “you put flour in a bowl and mix in eggs”.",
            "Now, ‘making fettuccine with the leftovers’ is a loose statement, as sometimes the time or ingredients available to us and nonna’s energy levels would dictate a strategic skipping straight through to leftovers. It was quicker than ravioli, so even though ravioli remained the main family dish, I think we probably ended up with more fettuccine in the freezer than anything else. In fact, the only thing more familiar to me than this pasta is the sugo and polpette that it would always be served with; so if you’re looking for the perfect sauce to pair with this fettuccine, check out our sugo and meatballs recipe!",
            "If I had to choose two things that mattered most in kneading pasta dough, I’d say time and moisture. Time being enough time spent kneading and resting the dough, and moisture referring to the perfect balance of wet and dry so that the dough can be handled without sticking, and with a minimal addition of flour. My rule of thumb for time is 10 minutes of vigorous kneading followed by 30 minutes of resting. I’ll also sometimes slow the rolling process (ie. leave sheets to rest in the open air a bit before proceeding) if the dough has sweated or feels too moist. If you get the water levels right before leaving it to rest, then you should be able to work with the weather (notwithstanding extremes) to perfect the dough’s moisture as you form it into pasta. Remember, eggs, oil, spinach, and any other non-dry ingredients, whilst all having their own separate properties, will add moisture. If you’re using extra-large eggs, or wetter spinach, you’ll probably need to increase your amount of flour.",
            "Everyone’s going to tell you to make a well with flour and put the eggs in the middle. You can do that if you want, because it’s cute, but if you don’t have the surface available (I will point out that our ‘surface’ used to be an old laminate table out the back) then honestly just do it in a bowl. You can still make a pretty well. Alternatively, if you’re really pressed for time and space, stick it in a food processor for a minute – but add the second half of the flour slowly until you see the dough come together and no longer stick to the sides. Even then, give it as long as you can afford with an old-fashioned hand knead afterwards, both to ensure the gluten’s done its thing, and to make sure that you haven’t under floured it. And I mean hard kneading that hurts your abs and makes you sweat. Don’t just touch it up. If my nonna could do it then you can.",
            "I normally stick it in a freezer bag to rest for 30 minutes, as I find it gives me a little more atmospheric control than in a bowl under a tea towel, but it can make your dough sweat. If that happens, just use a little flour as you start to cut it up and roll it out, but not so much that you mess up your water ratio. Cut it into smaller pieces to work one at a time, and leave the rest sealed away until needed. We try to minimise waste and plastics in our kitchen, and have dedicated reusables for resting dough and storing the odd half onion. Give it a shot – it makes everything taste about 15% better.",
            "You can roll pasta like this with just about anything: rolling pin, machine, wine bottle. Little Al often takes the initiative and sits on it over and over once I’m out of arm’s reach. We normally use a trusty hand cranked roller so that the little guy can get more involved, and sometimes even go old school with a rolling pin, but if we’re pressed for time there’s nothing wrong with electric. If you are using a machine option, always start on 0 and work up. In this case we’ve gone to 5, as I like my pasta thick. If you get holes or tears, fold it over, add a little flour, and put it back through. If you have to fold it more than once, consider dropping back down one setting before working up again. One important trick here is to pass the dough through the larger settings a few times (folding over itself in between) before you start thinning it. This essentially extends the kneading step and will make a big difference to ease of handling.",
            "Brush the sheets well with flour before feeding them through the fettucine cutter, or (if you’re using a pin) before rolling them up loosely and cutting across with a sharp knife. What?! Cut with a knife, but that’s tagliatelle! Spoiler, they’re the same thing made with a different cutter. Basically. Come at me North and South defenders of pasta.",
            "I recommend tossing the pasta loosely in flour as soon as it’s cut, and then sticking it straight into the fridge, uncovered. I really find that half an hour to overnight of refrigeration can add a great bit of bite to the pasta. You can keep storing it there too for up to a week, or a day for most filled pasta. Note that pasta does get quite brittle as it dries, but will gain a new elasticity when it finally reaches the pot.",

                    "Starting in the centre, use a fork or your hand to gradually incorporate the dry ingredients into the wet. If you’ve already formed a ball of dough, but it remains sticky, keep adding flour at no more than a tablespoon at a time.",
                    "Once the dough can be handled without sticking to your fingers or the work surface, begin kneading. You may have to keep adding some flour if it you notice it getting sticky during kneading – this is very much a step best judged by feel.",
                    "To knead, I recommend putting your weight down and forwards into the dough using the heel of your hand. You are trying to roll it forwards and fold it over at the same time, so the motion is down, forwards, and then up at the end of the push. Fold the flattened dough back towards you and over itself as you repeat. You want 10 minutes of hard kneading to really develop the gluten.",
                    "After 10 minutes, as long as you eliminated any sticking early in the knead, you should be left with a smooth, shiny ball of dough that requires no additional flouring.",
                    "Seal it in a  freezer bag, or any sealable plastic , and leave it to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. Try to keep it out of direct sunlight or heat, as that will cause the dough to sweat.",
                    "Cut the dough into four pieces, and return to the bag all but the single piece you'll begin working on. Using a pasta roller, or rolling pin, roll out and refold the dough 4-5 times into long strips. Think of this step as an extension of the kneading process. If on a  machine , just keep putting it through the 0 setting, refolding as you go. Flour lightly if you notice it sticking, and don't worry if you get some tears – just keep refolding to cover the tears, and re-rolling with a light dusting of flour. You'll notice that the dough becomes easier to handle the more times it passes through.",
                    "Begin stepping up the settings on the  machine , or if using a rolling pin, begin rolling thinner and thinner. I roll up to a machine setting of 5, but this will make quite thick pasta, so just keep going thinner if you prefer a lighter pasta. If you're rolling and cutting these by hand, remember to aim for long rectangular strips of the length you would like your fettuccine to be. The same applies to a machine, although the machine will dictate how wide each sheet will be.",
                    "Flour the sheets well, and pass through a fettuccine cutter. If you’re not using a machine, gently fold the sheets up into a roll, short end to short end, one at a time; cut into the desired fettuccine width using a short knife, and then unroll your individual pieces of pasta.",
                    "Toss your cut pasta loosely in flour until well coated and not sticking together. I find that allowing it to repeatedly fall from a height between my fingers, scooping with flour in between, works well.",
                    "Transfer to a sheet of baking paper and store uncovered in the fridge for up to a week. Even overnight will add a bit of bite to the pasta. Alternatively, freeze immediately.",
                    "Always use plenty of water when cooking, as it will prevent you from losing the boil when you drop the pasta in. We highly recommend serving it with  our signature tomato sauce and meatballs !"
